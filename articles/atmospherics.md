# A Quick and Incomplete Guide To SFX Mods for Morrowind
by Lucevar

Special effects are possibly my favourite category of Morrowind mod - they're often lightweight but have a huge impact on immersion and atmosphere. Below, you'll find some of my all-time favourites, although I unfortunately can't cover all of the mods that deserve to be covered.

I've included compatibility notes, but most of these mods are available for the original engine with MWSE-Lua only. A few are compatible with OpenMW. Remember to check the compatibility section!

# Lights and Lighting
![Glow in the Dahrk](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/45886/45886-1532322751-262693364.png)
[**Glow in the Dahrk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886) by Melchior Dahrk  
If you've been following Darkelfguy's Morrowind Modding Showcases for a while, you'll already know about this one. For a while it got a mention in every new video that game out. And, honestly, I'm 100% with Darkelfguy on this one. This is an incredible mod that makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the game. As darkness falls, lights start appearing in town windows - staggered so that they all don't switch on at once. As the sun starts to rise, they turn off again. Interior windows brighten or darken depending on the weather or the time of day. On bright days, you can have sunrays shine through interior windows. Telvanni settlements now have dormer windows. You can have Nordic village windows and Raven Rock windows light up, too. And the best part? Glow in the Dahrk is highly modular, so if you don't like one of these features, you can probably choose to turn it off.  
**Compatibility:** OpenMW and MWSE-Lua

[**The Midnight Oil**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48293) by Merlord  
This is the perfect companion to Glow in the Dahrk. Ever thought it was odd that people left lanterns on all day every day? Candles are too expensive for that! Cost-saving measures have been brought in all across Vvardenfell, and outside lanterns are now lit on a schedule. The schedule is staggered so that the lights don't all come on at once. On its own that would have been enough to make this an awesome mod, but wait, there's more! You can now manually toggle lights on and off - perfect for adjusting the atmosphere in your player home, or in any place you find yourself in, really. And if your held lights are running low on fuel, you can now buy refills from shops, or gather oil from the previously-useless ashmires in the Ashlands.  
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only

[**Douse the Lights**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47980) by OperatorJack  
Missing that Thief gameplay feeling? Want to turn off a light, but you don't want to walk across the room to do it? Want to feel like a ninja? Just throw your daggers at those pesky lights to turn 'em off! Shoot guards to blow out their torches. You can also shoot fires to douse them, which is something Midnight Oil doesn't cover I think.  
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.

[**Light Decay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46671) by Greatness7 and Melchior Dahrk  
Ever thought it was odd that your torches and lights are fine one moment, gone instantly the next? Now lights will begin to dim as they reach the end of their lifespan, giving you a visual cue that they're about to run out - and you should top them up with the refills from The Midnight Oil.   
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.

[**Blinking Dwemer Lights**](https://abitoftaste.altervista.org/morrowind/index.php?option=downloads&task=info&id=73&Itemid=50&-Dwemer-Blinking-Lights-1-1) by abot. Requires [Dwemer Blinking Lights](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42274) by qqqbbb.  
Some of the electric lights in Dwemer ruins will now flicker on and off, complete with eerie sound effects. Really adds to the atmosphere of these ruins, making them feel appropriately derelict.    
**Warning:** May not be suitable for sufferers of epilepsy - the flickering is quite pronounced.  
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with either OpenMW or the original engine.  

![Well Lit Lanterns](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/45801/45801-1529454496-766047059.jpeg)
[**Well Lit Lanterns**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45801) by Gruntella  
Travel lanterns now glow properly at night - a small change, but it makes a surprisingly big difference.  
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with either OpenMW or the original engine.

**Bonus Mention:** It's not a special effects mod as such, but RedFurryDemon's [**Let There Be Darkness**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47912) is the most customisable overhaul available for general lighting. Run it alongside these other mods for optimal effect.  
**Compatibility**: MWSE-Lua only.  

# Equipment
![Weapon Sheathing](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/46069/46069-1538638827-645975529.png)
[**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069) by Greatness7 & the community  
Did you ever stop to wonder how everyone in Morrowind can hide a claymore in their pocket? Miss the quivers and sheathes from later games? No need to miss them any more, they're here! Weapons and ammunition will now show up on your character model when equipped. Vanilla weapons come with their own unique sheathes, created as part of a big collaboration by the Morrowind modding community, but there's even in-built compatibility for mod-added weapons. By default the mod-added weapon will display, but by using the correct suffix on the mesh name Weapon Sheathing will be able to automatically detect mod-added sheathes too.  
**Compatibility:** Compatible with both OpenMW and MWSE-Lua.

![Vanity](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/48529/48529-1593772508-1108946024.jpeg)
[**Vanity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48529) by abot  
Vanity is for rings and amulets what Weapon Sheathing is for weapons. Now when you deck yourself out in bling, you'll be able to really appreciate it. Ideally use this with the Morrowind Code Patch option that allows you to wear three rings.  
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

# Sounds
[**AURA**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48255) by tewlwolow  
A MWSE-based, highly customisable sound overhaul. Also includes some optional vanilla sound replacements. This mod probably has too many features for me to fully explain here (and it's still under active development!), but some highlights include new ambient sounds for the outdoors, interior weather sounds, and shipmasters and caravaners will now play an audio line when you use their travel services. 
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

[**Kirel's Interior Weather**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-3021) by Kirel  
An alternate interior weather sounds mod, if you use OpenMW or if, like me, you find AURA's interior weathers difficult to hear. It definitely reduces the feeling that you're walking into a sterile bubble any time you transfer into an interior cell. You can hear the muted burble of rain on the roof or the low roar of an ashstorm raging outside.
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with both OpenMW and MWSE-lua.

[**Heartthrum**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47178/) by OperatorJack and RedFurryDemon  
Hear the still-beating heart of Lorkhan, faint at first as you approach Red Mountain, increasing in intensity as you ascend towards the crater citadels. An incredibly atmospheric addition to the game.
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

[**Sound of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
If you've ever thought that it's a little bit creepy that Tamriel is so blasé about people walking around casually killing things so that their souls can be eternally imprisoned and used to power enchantments for cheap trinkets, this mod isn't going to change your mind. Soulgems in the worldspace, in the inventory, or being interacted with (ie being used for enchanting) now have a chance to play one of the sounds belonging to their creature. By the power of MWSE-Lua this also applies to soulgems containing creatures added by mods. Haunting and creepy. Avoid enchanters!
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

[**Store Entrance Chimes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44586) by R-zero  
Many Imperial shops and taverns now have chimes on the doors. Now whenever you enter a shop, one of four random sounds will play. The chimes are separate objects attached to the doors, so you can even walk up and ring them manually if you want. Like the interior weather mods, this one is great for getting rid of that sense that you're stepping into a completely different world when you enter an interior - it really helps make the transition feel grounded.  
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with both OpenMW and MWSE-lua.


# Worldspace
![Mistify](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/48112/48112-1590162673-1655438406.jpeg)
[**Mistify**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48112) by Melchior Dahrk  
Mistify causes mist to appear at night or in certain weather conditions all throughout the Bitter Coast. It makes the swamps much spookier, and also incredibly beautiful. It's been optimised so the FPS impact should be relatively small.  
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with both OpenMW and MWSE-lua.

![Unto Dust](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/48435/48435-1592855559-940453982.jpeg)
[**Unto Dust**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48435) by Melchior Dahrk  

**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

![Pincushion](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/46862/46862-1559435310-101526044.jpeg)
[**Pincushion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46862) by Hrnchamd  
Goes excellentlty with [**Dartboards Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47976)!
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

[**Morrowind Containers Animated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42238) by qqqbbb  
**Compatibility:** Link above is for MWSE-Lua, OpenMW compatible version [available here](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46232).

[**Graphic Herbalism**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599) by Stuporstar & Greatness7  
**Compatibility:** Compatible with both MWSE-Lua and OpenMW.  

[**Shattered Stones**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) by R-zero and Greatness7
**Compatibility:** MWSE-Lua only.  

# Objects
![Throbbing Meat](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/45339/45339-1519417720-361595880.jpeg)
[**R-Zero's Throbbing Meat**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45339) by R-Zero  
This is an animated replacer for corprus meat chunks, based on the premise that even when they're cut off from their host, the hunks continue to "live" and mutate. Corprus meat now sometimes has eyes, teeth, and hair - and it visibly throbs and pulses. It is vile, disgusting, disturbing on a visceral level... and thus incredibly effective at what it sets out to do. 10/10 would recommend.  
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with both MWSE-Lua and OpenMW.  

![Nocturnal Moths](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/100/images/44148-0-1457131648.jpg)
[**Nocturnal Moths**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44148) by R-zero  
On clear nights, moths will now be attracted to outside lanterns, swarming around them.
**Compatibility:** Should be compatible with both MWSE-Lua and OpenMW.  

And that's it for now! Thanks for sticking with me this far, and happy Morrowind-ing. For even more SFX mods (but way less waffle), check out my [SFX mods list](https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods/blob/master/sfx.md)
