The life of a marksman is one of advantage. Distance, time, initiative. But, when it's all over there is no trace of your work. Wouldn't it be satisfying to see your arrows, bolts and darts sticking into men, mer, tavern doors, and signposts alike? This mod is for you. Place an arrow right between their eyes.

[**Tooltips Complete**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46842) by Anumaril  
Tooltips Complete provides helpful and lore-friendly flavour texts for nearly every item in Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, the Official Plugins, and an expanding collection of mods.

[**Book Worm**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46851) by Merlord  
Keep track of what books you have read by showing a "(Read)" indicator next to their names. You can also see a list of previously read books in the MCM menu.

[**Weather Adjuster**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46816) by Hrnchamd  
Regional weather colours, skies and lighting. Visual weather editor and region-based presets. Seamless transitions between regions. Share your presets.

[**Merlord's Character Backgrounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) by Merlord  
Select from 26 different backgrounds, each with their own unique effects.

[**Go Fletch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46752) by Merlord  
Go Fletch adds a brand new Fletching skill to the game, utilising the latest skill and crafting frameworks in MWSE to fully integrate it into the vanilla UI.

[**Quick Loadouts**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46708) by Merlord  
Quick Loadouts adds hotkeys for equipping entire sets of gear. You can customise whether a loadout includes weapons, armor, clothing and accessories in the MCM menu.  

[**Drop Light**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46694) by NullCascade  
This mod causes certain lights to be dropped when the player equips a two handed weapon or a shield while holding a light in combat. Only lights that are on by default will be dropped.

[**Visually Filled Soul Gems**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46709) by NullCascade  
This mod makes in-world soulgems that are filled appear as enchanted items.

[**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord  
Marksman Rebalanced takes into account the distance to target when calculating the hit chance for ranged weapons. This applies to both the player and NPCs. Crouching also provides a boost to hit chance.

[**Kill Command**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46723) by Merlord  
Adds a configurable hotkey that will send all companions to attack whatever you are currently looking at.

[**Limited Intervention**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46687) by Merlord  
This mod limits the number of times you can cast Divine and ALMSIVI Intervention, based on your ranks in the Divine Cult and Tribunal Temple, respectively. MCM settings allow you to choose how many interventions are granted to you per rank. Scrolls and enchantments are not affected. 

[**The Last Witness**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46684) by NullCascade  
This mod allows you to kill all the witnesses of a crime to remove the bounty. The player must be quick though, as word spreads fast.

[**Light Decay**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46671) by Melchior Dahrk and Greatness7  
The radius of a handheld light will gradually diminish and eventually go out when the light extinguishes.

[**Realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673) by Merlord  
Realistic Repair overhauls the repair mechanic, by making it so that repair hammers can only be used by activating an anvil, and prongs used by activating a forge.

[**Give a Gift**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46661) by NullCascade  
The player can now also bribe NPCs with items, instead of just gold.

[**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632) by Merlord  
Bed Buddies prevents you from sleeping in owned beds unless the owner really likes you. Disposition requirement is based on your Personality. Attempting to sleep in an owned bed no longer triggers a crime, even if the owner doesn't like you.  

[**Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599) by Stuporstar and Greatness7  
Now works with OpenMW! MWSE Graphic Herbalism harnesses the power of lua and mesh switchnodes, allowing this mod to be run without an esp or standard scripts. This dramatically optimizes performance compared to older graphic herbalism mods. It also comes with an mod configuration menu to allow you to change settings.

[**Illiterate**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46600) by Petethegoat  
Read is hard. Me not read until me brain get bigger. Me like pictures, no need read.  

[**Wings of Will**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626) by sataniel  
In the base game, the levitation speed is based on the Speed attribute. This never made much sense to me. You can levitate faster by being a great runner? Now levitation is based on the Willpower attribute (just as the Alteration skill is) with other calculations remaining the same.


[**Perfect Placement**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46562) by Hrnchamd  
Adds interactive placement, rotation and wall mounting of items. Arrange gear, books and anything else you can pick up.
- Perfect Placement places the item exactly on top of surfaces in horizontal mode, and auto-aligns the item against vertical surfaces while in vertical mode.
- Items in Vertical Mode can be mounted to walls just by placing them against a wall.
- Rotation Snap lets you line up books precisely.
- Copy Last Rotation causes the held item to match the rotation of the last item you placed.
- Carry your stuff around anywhere, but you will drop it if you have to ready your weapons or magic!

[**GMST Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46428) by Merlord  
Edit literally every GMST in the game, while you're in the game!  


[**MWSE Clock Block**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46292?) by Al3ister  
Adds clock to UI that displays either game world time or real time (depending on settings)  


[**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack  
This mod uses MWSE Lua to modify movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important. These changes automatically apply to the player and any NPCs / Creatures (modded or vanilla) without using a plugin or altering your savegame.  

[**MWSE Character Creation Name Generator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46189) by Aleist3r  
UI addition for chargen that allows you to generate a random name for your character at the start of the game.  

[**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069) by Greatness7 & community modellers  
Equipped weapons no longer disappear when lowered. Instead they will be shown on the character's hip or back. This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.  

[**UI Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071/?) by NullCascade  
Expands UI functionality with searching, filtering, and more visual feedback.  

[**Skills Module**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034) by Merlord  
Skills Module is a framework for MWSE+Lua mods that allows you to easily create new skills in Morrowind with just a few lines of code. Leveling and UI are handled automatically, with new skills added seamlessly into the stats menu.  

[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Aka Modder's Delight. Even with the Code Patch Morrowind often crashes on exit, requiring you to kill the process in task manager just to get out of it. It's an irritating waste of time when you're playing, and even worse when you're testing mods and quitting Morrowind 10+ times an hour. This mod squashes that crash, making exiting as quick and easy as it always should have been.  

[**Dynamic Difficulty**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45710) by NullCascade  
Configurable difficulty. You can change the base difficulty, make the game harder or easier as you level up, or set the difficulty per region (so you could make the Bitter Coast very easy but the Ashlands much more dangerous, for example).  

[**Easy Escort**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712) by NullCascade  
Vanilla escort quests are a nightmare because of the terrible pathfinding AI. This mod keeps followers close to you and ensures they don't get stuck on a rock in the ashlands somewhere.  

[**Diligent Defenders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45717) by NullCascade  
When combat begins, your companions will start to defend you immediately, instead of waiting for you to be attacked first. A real lifesaver if that enemy is going to kill you in one hit and you can't afford to wait!  

[**Proportional Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45697) by NullCascade  
Allows you to easily adjust the progression rate to make leveling skills slower/faster, based on a number of different factors.  

[**Memory Monitor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696) by NullCascade  
Provides an in-game alert if you're close to reaching the 4GB memory limit, so that you can save and restart in time to prevent a crash.  


[**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
Adds a chance for soul gems to emit a sound from the creature whose soul they contained. Very atmospheric. *Very* creepy.  

[**Poison Crafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729) by Greatness7  
Adds a new poison mechanic similar to Oblivion and Skyrim's. NPCs can use poison as well! Also allows you to use apparatus in-world rather than having to pick it up and use it from your inventory, and a new alchemy mode where better apparatus decreases positive effects rather than negative so you can craft your own poisons.  


[**Glow in the Dahrk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886) by Melchior Dahrk & NullCascade  
The most up-to-date and feature rich version of Windows Glow. Includes much more subtle and aesthetically pleasing windows glow, randomly spaced lighting so not every window turns on precisely at dusk and off precisely at dawn, and automatic compatibility with mods using vanilla meshes (such as Tamriel Rebuilt). No more need for infinite patches just to make your windows light up!  

[**Brutal Backstabbing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45890) by Merlord  
Do more damage when stabbing an enemy from behind (NPCs can also backstab - beware turning your back!).  

[**Automated Ammo Equip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45845) by Merlord  
Ever want to use both crossbows and regular bows, but get annoyed at having to remember to switch ammo type? This automates it for you.  

[**Putting Power in Willpower**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742) by R-Zero  
Willpower is described as affecting your abilities to resist spells, but in vanilla it is bugged and doesn't work. This mod enables it, for PCs and NPCs.  

[**MWSE Alchemy Filter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44808) by Greatness7  
You can now filter ingredients based on their effects.  

[**MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554) by svengineer99  
Adds new services to enchanters, including the ability to recharge enchanted items and making additional copies of scrolls.  


[**Ownership Indicator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45940) by Petethegoat  
Ownership Indicators adds an Oblivion style ownership indicator, when you look at owned items, beds, and more. Compatible with all crosshair texture replacements. Uses Lua instead of old MWSE/MGE functions as previous ownership indicators have.  

[**Continue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45952/) by Petethegoat  
Adds a continue button to the main menu, to instantly load your most recent save. This can also optionally hide the credits button to stop the main menu from becoming too cluttered. This also includes a secret testing feature to load into a specified save game even faster- uncomment two of the lines at the top of main.lua, and choose a filename and key code. Instantly load into a save by holding your key while the game starts up. Several menu texture replacers have compatibility options for this.  

[**UI Inspector**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45964/) by Hrnchamd  
UI viewer and interactive editor for Morrowind UIs. Allows inspection of the UI menu hierarchy and all layout values. Layout variables can be modified in-game for fine-tuning your own UIs.
