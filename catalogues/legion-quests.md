# Imperial Legion
* [**Quest Tweaks & Alternatives 1.19**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ihtlpfrzfhiwxo/QTA_1.19.7z?dl=0) by Stuporstar  
-- The Imperial Legion has few quest rewards, only giving out armor with advancement. Now all quests that formerly didn't give out rewards give Imperial Legion scrip.
-- Imperial Legion scrip can be turned in to IL smiths and healers for repair items or potions. Each scrip is worth ~60 gold, but you get more for your "money" when you turn it in to IL vendors.
-- You have to turn in scrip through dialogue, the advantage of scrip being you don't have to rely on your mercantile skill to get deals on repair items and potions. With scrip, you get an automatic discount on IL goods.
-- IL scrip is basically a deferred quest reward that you can turn in for a small reward of your choice (or save for a slightly bigger one).
-- You can get potions from priests and healers, scrolls from priests, repair hammers from smiths and traders, and booze from IL traders and publicans in Imperial towns.
