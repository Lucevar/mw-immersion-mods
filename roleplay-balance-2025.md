A MWSE-based list of recommendations for making the world more immersive, RP-friendly, and "balanced". Let me clarify what I mean by balance here.

Mostly out of scope for this mod list: graphics mods and general immersive things unrelated to game mechanics.

## Chargen
* [**Chargen Scenarios**](https://github.com/jhaakma/chargenScenarios) by Merlord    
* [**Treat Custom Race as Vanilla Race**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52346) by AlandroSul  
A simple tweak to allow you to set the PCRace global through dialogue in order to get appropriate race-based dialogue in-game when playing as a custom race.
* [**FMI - The Role They Were To play**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46411) by PoodleSandwich  
Changes the intro cinematic from "he" to "they", so the intro doesn't contradict character selection.
* [**Merlord's Character Backgrounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) by Merlord    
Select from 27 different backgrounds, each with their own unique effects.
* [**The Wretched And The Weird**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55570) by AlandroSul  
9 new character backgrounds for Merlord's Character Backgrounds, focusing on challenge characters, the wretched, and the weird. 
* [**More Backgrounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48076) by IsNaN  
Adds a handful of new backgrounds to Merlord's character backgrounds. Some provide more of a flying start, but they all have harsher setbacks or challenges for later.
* [**Randomised Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46915) by Petethegoat    
Lets you randomise your race, appearance, class, and birthsign.
* [**Ahead of the Classes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50346) by Danae    
100+ classes (vanilla, NPC classes, TR classes, new classes) that get a specific set of items and/or spells and powers as well as MWSE skill buffs. specifically tailored to your class. 
* [**All Races and Classes Unlocked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53710) by Tiny Plesiosaur   
Enables all vanilla NPC classes, all Tamriel_Data classes, and all Tamriel_Data races at character creation. 
* [**Written in the Stars**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50378) by Danae  
Each birthsign now has a few variants (including the original one) for a grand total of 40 new lore-friendly birthsigns. 
* [**Character Goals**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55047) by Lucevar  
Set a goal for your character! See it on your character sheet, generate a random goal, write a custom goal yourself.
* [**Character Goals Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55080) by NewVegasRaider  
An extra set of goals as an addon to the ones from Character Goals.
* [**Class Skill Limit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989) by VitruvianGuar  
Caps skills depending on the class you choose, making the initial choice much more impactful. No more being able to master everything on one character!
* [**Ashfall Survival Start**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52880) by JosephMcKean  
You are stranded on an island called Masartus. Your objective is to craft a raft so you can find your way back to Vvardenfell.
* [**Alternate Chargen - Passenger Not Prisoner**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55642) by dumbcter  
Arrive as a passenger instead of a prisoner. Includes shipwrecked in Sheogorad option.

## Economy
### Philosophy
* Life in Morrowind, especially for beginner adventurers, is harsh, and expensive, and it should be a struggle to save money. 
* You should be able to eke out a living doing basic tasks, maybe crafting, maybe entertaining the patrons as a bard, until your adventuring skills get to a point where risks pay off.
* But after paying for food, and rent, and maybe that pesky skooma addiction, there shouldn't be much left over for luxuries like training or fast travel.
* Purchases of things like spells and training should be weighty. Beginner adventurers should not be buying a spell merchant's whole stock in one go. This helps to encourage making creative use of each spell. And, if you're using a mod that adds spell books to find out in the world, makes those potentially really meaningful now.
* High value items are both rarer and less valuable in the Morrowind this mod list creates - but selling one should still be enough to finally buy that nice bit of armour you've been saving for.
* Merchants should be shrewd negotiators - but with enough variation in skill that a savvy player can still make money. 
* Big purchases like houses should tend towards 'thousands' rather than 'hundreds of thousands', because making large piles of money should be much more difficult. I don't want houses to be end-game content unless they're extremely big.

In short, the aim is to make things difficult enough to acquire that, when you do, it's a big moment, and a real power-up.

### Mod Recs
* [**Wares Ultimate**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52013) by Danae  
Keeps shopping interesting by completely overhauling leveled lists and allowing for a huge number of modded items to be added to them in a way that makes sense and is lore friendly. Danae has also provided a large number of addons for various mods.
* [**DRIP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51242) by Merlord  
Keeps shopping interesting by adding a chance for some unenchanted items in stores and containers to randomly be converted to enchanted ones, Diablo-style.  
**Recommendation**: turn the percentage chance much lower in the MCM. 1-2% is a good level imo. Otherwise they're too common and start to overshadow quest rewards.
* [**Better Balanced Booze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45844) by mort  
Makes booze less OP. **Recommendation**: use the hardcore version, which keeps the vanilla negative effects, but reduces the positive ones.
* [**ItemList**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47224) by VenomByte  
Ups the level at which the best items appear, so smugglers caves don't suddenly become treasure troves... or at least not so quickly.
* [**GameStat**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47224) by VenomByte  
Tweaks several GMSTs to make services more expensive and self-repairs less effective.

## Gold & Pricing
* [**Buying Game Updated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54136) by Vaelta & VitruvianGuar  
Traders now drive a much harder bargain. Players unskilled in mercantile may not even know the value of the items they're trying to sell. Regional prices - buy low in some places and sell high in others. Items with negative quantities restock over time instead of instantly. Invest in your favourite merchants. Most importantly -- will take a lot of gold out of your pockets.
* [**Price Balance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45529) by Dungeom  
**Recommendation**: Use Items.esp + Service.esp + Creatures.esp + Crime.esp + Museum.esp. Skip Extra.esp.
* [**Price Balance - TR**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53793) by kinnairdclan  
Equivalent changes for TR items.
* [**Worth Its Weight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48070) by JaceyS  
Adds weight to gold. Makes the various banking and companion mods much more meaningful when gold is difficult to lug around in large quantities!  
**Recommendation**: use the experimental branch


### Banking Options
* [**Project Tamriel / Tamriel Rebuilt's Briricca Bank**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537)  
PTR adds a bank, with branches in various locations. Requires the player to have a certain level of local reputation before you can open an account. 
* [**Imperial Bank**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54889) by Vaelta  
Adds bank branches throughout Vvardenfell and PTR. Also adds quests! 
* [**Wealth Beyond Measure**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54792) by GOOGLEPOX  
Adds another "Imperial Bank", along with a much more extensive overhaul of currency useage. I don't currently use this one, but I have in the past. It's good!
* [**Wealth Beyond Measure - Kalinter Vanilla-Friendly Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53398) by Kalinter
* [**Null's Wealth Beyond Measure 1.2.0 patch to fix creatures**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55897) by NullCascade

## Quality of Life
* [**Just Drop It**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49557) by Merlord  
Dropped items and corpses are automatically positioned and oriented to align with the ground.
* [**Easy Escort**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712) by NullCascade  
Ensures that your followers get warped to you if they get too far away. Compatible with any follower from any mod, without any special script attached to that NPC.
* [**Diligent Defenders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45717) by NullCascade  
This module makes it so that when the player or the player's companions are attacked, any companions will launch into action in defense.
* [**Right Click Menu Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48458) by Merlord  
This mod provides one simple feature: any menu can be exited by right clicking. This includes dialog and barter menus, any service menus, as well as the main menu, save/load menu etc. 
* [**Auto Attack**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51348) by Merlord  
Won't be necessary for many -- but if you have wrist problems like I do, and find combat a bit of a slog, this is a life-saving mod.
* [**Gameplay Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53159) by abot  
Collection of tweaks to various things. Disable any you don't need.  
* [**Small QoL Improvements - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53905) by Spammer  
Assorted QoL tweaks, inc. a map hotkey, equipping scrolls readying the spell instead of making you read it, NPCs will turn to face you when you speak to them, reducing the amount of combat taunts, quest giver dialogue gets written to journal.
* [**UI expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071) by NullCascade  
Absolutely essential. Expands global map so you can see all of PTR. Expands UI functionality with searching, filtering, and more visual feedback.
* [**Clocks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50840) by Wisp  
This mod adds a customizable real-time and/or in-game time clock in the HUD, and the ability to switch between them with a customizable key. This is a rewrite of the MWSE Clock Block by Aleist3r, featuring user-requested functionality and code improvements.
* [**Kill Command**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46723) by Merlord  
Adds a configurable hotkey that will send all companions to attack whatever you are currently looking at.
* [**HUD Encumbrance Bar**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49608) by OperatorJack  
Now you can see your level of encumbrance alongside health/magicka/stamina etc.  
* [**HUD Weapon Charge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47962) by Virnetch  
Now you can see how much enchantment charge your weapon has left. Particularly important with Enchantment Services Redone installed, since by default weapons no longer recharge, or with VenomByte's GameStat, which makes them recharge much slower.

## Gameplay Additions
* [**herbert lib**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53803) by herbert  
Required by a few mods on this list. Does nothing by itself.  
* [**Skills Module**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034) by Merlord  
Skills framework required for many mods below.
* [**Crafting Framework**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51009) by Merlord  
The Crafting Framework is library that allows modders to quickly and easily implement complex crafting mechanics in Morrowind.
* [**Ashfall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057) by Merlord    
THE survival mod. Survival mod with hunger, thirst, tiredness, cooking, camping, crafting and temperature mechanics, and new visuals, from seeing frost on your breath in cold weather, watching your food cook on the grill in real time, and seeing your camping gear displayed dynamically on your backpack.
* [**Tea Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51656) by Juidius   
Adds merchants around Vvardenfell who'll sell you a nice hot cup of tea. Requires Ashfall.  
* [**Interop for Tea Mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50789) by Aldurion    
This is an interop file to make the food, tea and coffee ingredients added by Stuporstar's Tea Mod work through Ashfall's framework. Requires Stuporstar's Tea Mod - either the [**original**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54144) or [**RandomPal's version**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54507) which moves the shop to Old Ebonheart.
**Recommendation**: I use RandomPal's. The customer base for exotic teas must be higher in OE than on an isolated peninsula outside a castle.
* [**Luxury Camping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54767) by Lucevar   
Adds some new bedrolls, straw beds, and tents for you to craft via Ashfall. Meshes by the amazing DimNussens.
* [**Wooden Animals**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53503) by Stele    
Carved wooden animal figurines. Guar, Scrib and Kagouti. Craftable by player using Ashfall.
* [**Ashfall bushcrafting for realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55893) by codering  
Adds a Stone Anvil and Stone Prongs to Ashfall's bushcrafting menu that allows you to repair your equipment with Realistic Repair. Both recipes unlock at Armorer 25 (Apprentice).
[**Corkcrafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54538) by Juidius  
Optional download in Moruhn Corkbulb Manor. Allows you to craft things out of corkbulb.
* [**Joy of Painting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53036) by Merlord  
Adds a feature-rich painting mechanic to Morrowind, letting you create paintings of in-game scenery that exist not just in the game as objects but are also saved as high-res images on your PC so you can use them outside the game.
* [**Ultimate Fishing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52872) by Merlord   
Adds a fishing mechanic with over 25 species of fish and dynamic fishing animations.
* [**Bound fishing pole**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54630) by Stele  
Artifact of Hircine? Abomination of Sheogorath? Who cares! Now you can train casting conjuration while casting the line at the same time.
* [**Go Fletch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46752) by Merlord    
Go Fletch adds a brand new Fletching skill to the game, utilising the latest skill and crafting frameworks in MWSE to fully integrate it into the vanilla UI.
* [**Bardic Inspiration**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45441) by Merlord  
Learn songs from other bards. Book performances with innkeepers. 38 songs to learn. New 'Performance' skill. Dynamic replacement of vanilla lutes with equippable versions.
* [**Entertainers Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44764) by Ian  
An expanded version of the official Entertainers plug-in. Now you can perform at inns all across Vvardenfell.
* [**Entertainers Expanded Again**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46889) by Chantox  
Now you can grow your skills as an entertainer over time, you'll get more rewards as you grow in skill, and there's more variety in your performances.
* [**Skoomaesthesia**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49920) by Merlord    
Adds new skooma mechanics including animated skooma pipe smoking, psychedelic shaders and sound effects, and skooma addiction.
* [**Give a gift**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46661) by NullCascade  
The player can now also bribe NPCs with items, instead of just gold.
* [**Vvardenfell Ablutions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54401) by AlandroSul  
A bathing mod. Wash regularly to stay clean and healthy. If you don't wash, people will dislike you -- which as it turns out is a great way to hear the fantastic low-disposition dialogue from vanilla and mods like S.W.I.T by Kildozery. Also makes bathhouses, water basins, and soaps meaningful instead of cosmetic.  
* [**Chalk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54043) by ManaUser  
This mod adds sticks of chalk. These can be used to write on the ground, walls, or other surfaces. A selection of pre-set text and symbols are provided, but you can also spell your own message by letter.
* [**Dragon-Killing Chalk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55773) by Dorfklaus  
Adds the anti-Imperial graffiti from Imperials Go Home to the Chalk menus.


## Map
* [**Player Marker Begone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55675) by Zigi  
Replaces the player marker on the global map with a blank dds, reducing the unrealistic amount of information thats available to you. Now you'll have to navigate other ways. Even if you're very familiar with Morrowind, you're likely to get lost again!  
* [**Off the Map**](https://github.com/Petethegoat/off-the-map) by Petethegoat  
Local map is disabled. The global map no longer centres on the player. The global map will now no longer colour in as you explore. Continues the good work of Player Marker Begone by removing extra sources of information the player doesn't have an in-universe reason to have. As a bonus, you'll no longer feel the need to explore every. single. square. of the map just to fill it in, even when you're no longer having fun exploring that area. Or is that just a me thing?
* [**Immersive Compass**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51126) by Safebox  
Allows you to choose how much information the compass marker on your minimap will give, and also adds an in-game compass to buy and carry. There's an animation that plays that will show you which direction you're currently facing. 
* [**Useful Maps and Guides**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51278) by Lucevar  
Maps will now mark the town locations on your map.

## Minigames
* [**Roll the Dice**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54134) by XeroFoxx  
  A Simple Mod that allows you to roll any dice found in Tamriel Rebuilt or OAAB Data by simply equipping it in your inventory. Gives options to roll 1 or 2 dice.
* PTR adds a whole bunch of minigames.
* [**Casino Gambling**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56015) by CarlZee  
Adds 3 casinos and 5 new games to win money, or lose it all!
* [**Thirteen Telvanni**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52081) by Dillonn241    
Adds a 2-to-4-player, fully playable card game to the world, with betting, available at several taverns and other gathering places. Uses the Telvanni suit and Morag Tong card from Tamriel_Data's Dunmer card set.  
* [**Nine-Holes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52093) by Dillonn241  
Adds playable Nine-holes boards to Vvardenfell, with an AI to challenge you and the option to bet gold.
* [**The Royal Game of Ur**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44945) by Lord Berandas  
This mod adds pieces of ancient dwemer boardgame into various ruins around Vvardenfell. Can you collect them all?
* [**Playable Royal Game of Ur**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53914) by Dillonn241  
Adds a playable version of the board game The Royal Game of Ur to Vvardenfell, with betting and practice options against a full AI. Requires assets from the mod "The Royal Game of Ur" by LordBerandas.
**Recommendation**: Grab the voice lines for Hasphat Antabolis too!  

## Racism
* [**Enslaved - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51365?tab=description) by Spammer   
 If you're playing as an Argonian or a Khajiit, adds a small (configurable) chance to get abducted during your sleep by slave traders. 
* [**LDM - Racist Service Refusal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50870) by Lucevar  
Camonna Tong NPCs will now refuse to provide services to Argonians and Khajiit unless at a very high disposition.
* [**Nastier Camonna Tong**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22601?tab=description) by von Djangos  
Adds more offensive greetings to members of the Camonna Tong. Responses range from surly and difficult to outright racist slurs if your character is Khajiit or Argonian. Fixes some Balmora dialogue bugs in relation to the Camonna Tong. 
* [**Imperials Go Home**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44984) by Rats  
Adds 50 hidden or semi-hidden "graffiti" with anti-Imperial messages painted on the walls of Imperial settlements and guildhalls around Vvardenfell. Finding and cleaning the vandalized walls will earn the player various rewards such as gold and better reputation with Imperial factions. Finding all 50 will yield a special recognition from the Imperial government. However, cleaning the signs of protest will incur the wrath of Kuvat Tong, a guild of Dark Elven calligraphers.
* [**Racism**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674?tab=files) by rot  
NPCs now dislike you more (-15 disposition) if you're not of the same race. Goes well with Real Disposition for a very tough start. 

## Gameplay Changes
* [**Realistic Repair**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673) by Merlord  
Repair hammers can only be used by activating an anvil, and prongs by activating a forge. No more fully repairing your intricate (and absolutely destroyed) armour on the fly in a swamp somewhere. Also, when an NPC dies, their armour will be damaged. This makes fighting bandits much less lucrative. 
* [**Realistic Repair -- Add-on**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47461) by Corsair  
Adds more places in cities for you to repair your stuff, since the vanilla placements are limited. Don't use the optional esp from Realistic Repair.
* [**Proportional progression expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53782) by herbert  
Choose your own adventure for leveling speed. Configure leveling rate for skills globally or individually.  
* [**Misc Mates**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48122) by Merlord  
Your friends won't try to kill you if you accidentally pick up a fork.
* [**Bed Buddies**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46632) by Merlord  
Your friends will let you sleep in their bed.
* [**Loading Doors Lock Tune**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46094) by abot  
Synchronises both sides of a door (great for use with pursuit mods), and also plays a door-closing sound when going through doors. 
* [**Passing Time While Reading**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48059/) by abot  
Time now passes while you're reading books.  
* [**Reading Is Good**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51705) by Publicola and Spammer  
Skill books now add stacking, permanent bonuses to xp gain rather than directly giving you a skill point -- meaning you no longer have to avoid reading books so you can read them at a more "optimal" time. 
* [**Speed Boost**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47896) by OperatorJack  
With the rest of this mod list installed, you're going to be broke and having to walk a lot of places instead of fast travelling. That's going to be truly painful if you have to crawl around at the vanilla speeds. This mod speeds you up (at a rate configurable in game) -- but it also speeds up NPCs and creatures, so you don't get an unfair advantage.  
**Recommendation**: try setting it to 125% and adjust from there.
* [**17 Percent Faster Walking**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48955) by alvazir  
Oddly specific number, but goes well with Speed Boost. Makes walking, specifically, just a bit faster, to encourage you to slow down and take in the sights without driving you absolutely bonkers.
* [**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack  
Modifies movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.
* [**Silver Tongue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086) by VitruvianGuar  
Makes speechcraft progression much more meaningful.
* [**Illiterate**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46600) by Petethegoat  
If your intelligence is too low, either naturally or due to magic, you can't read. 
* [**Who is that?**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56073) by codering  
The changes from this mod list make the world brutally dangerous. Use this mod to help decide if an enemy is someone you can face or if you should run for the hills. 
* [**Daily Training**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51845) by Kleidium  
Immersive way to trian -- while waiting. Particularly useful given how expensive training is now.  
* [**Time Consumer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51396) by Kleidium  
Lots of actions now take time. Goes great with Passing Time While Reading and Ashfall.
* [**A Sinking Feeling**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50113) by lemmingbas  
No longer can you swim in heavy plate; now your armour, equipment, or carried items drag you down while swimming. Options exist for formulas based on equipped armour weight class, total equipment weight, or encumbrance percentage.
* [**Hold Your Breath**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48872) by Stripes  
Endurance determines how long you can hold your breath under water.
* [**Aquatic Ascendancy**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52823) by Kleidium  
Argonians (and vampires) can breathe and rest underwater. Argonians can also swim faster. Compatible with the Temple quest by default.
* [**Limited Leaping**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299) by NullCascade  
Puts optional restrictions on jumping, including a cooldown and/or minimum fatigue.
* [**Descriptive Shrines - Healing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46119) by SuperQuail  
Shrines now have their descriptions from "Consolations of Prayer" when you activate them, and offer healing services. 

## Stealth
<!-- * [**Stealth Improved**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49614) by mort  
Rebuilds stealth mechanics from the ground up, and makes sneaking a viable playstyle. The sneak icon now fades based on your stealth level, attacks made from behind while stealthed now guarantee a hit. Invisibility is reduced in power for realism and balance (but still great) --  invisibility makes you permanently "behind the enemy" and provides a flat bonus.  
Removed for now because of AI response delays-->
* [**Pickpocket**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47581) by mort  
Adds a custom real-time menu to pickpocketing that shows you any items you have the skill level to steal. There are caveats; if they have it equipped, they get a bonus to their check. That means your chances of stealing a dagger off a thief are
pretty much zero. But it's possible. Merchants get a bonus to their check to prevent the theft. Makes Security useful even in a world where Alteration exists, and vastly reduces the compulsion to save-scum. 
* [**Security Enhanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47038) by OperatorJack  
Quality of life mod. If you try to activate a locked door, your character will automatically equip a lockpick unless they have a key.   
**Recommendation**: disable auto-equip on activating trapped objects in the MCM because it trivialises the trap mechanic.
* [**Marksman Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46715) by Merlord  
Shooting from stealth increases the chance to hit. 
* [**Pluginless and Adjustable Lower First Person Sneak**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48642) by lemmingbas  
Lower first-person sneak, but without a plugin, and adjustable on the fly, via MCM.

## Magic
* [**Magicka Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111) by OperatorJack  
A lua-based framework for creating new, fully functional magic effects. Currently adds 110 new magic effects and spellbooks.
<!-- * [**Disarm Trap Spell**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55055) by Syanide  
Adds the equivalent of Open, but for dealing with traps. Requires Magicka Expanded.
Commented out because bugged -->
* [**MM Invisibility Enhanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565) by Vtastek, OperatorJack & Karpulio   
Using invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Also, under the effect of invisibility, Daedra and undead creatures will seem... different.
* [**Customizable MWSE Multi Mark and Harder Recall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47065) by Virnetch  
An overhaul of the mark and recall system to allow:
- Multiple mark locations, even from other mods. Teleport companions to your location. Limit number of marks by mysticism.
- Higher magicka cost and lower cast chance for long recall distances.
- Limited number of daily recalls. 
**Recommendation**: Toggle off the "limited recall" feature. Mostly just annoying.
* [**Proportional Magicka Regeneration**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53804) by herbert  
Magicka regeneration depends on willpower, making willpower an actually useful stat.  
* [**Disobedient Summons**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51483) by Spammer  
Careful with those summoning scrolls! NPCs can steal your summons if they roll the dice well and have a higher conjuration score than you. But *you* can also steal *their* summons.
* [**Illegal Summoning**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105) by OperatorJack   
Vanilla dialogue says you're not meant to be summoning in town. Now you're *really* not meant to.  
* [**Bad Default Spells (and Burden)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674?tab=files) by rot  
Removes a bunch of useless spells from the auto-calc list. Makes NPCs generally more dangerous.
* [**Arcane Implements - Cantrips Spellbooks and Runes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55836) by Danae  
Learn cantrips from scrolls, spells from spellbooks and summon things from Oblivion with Daedric Runes. Adds more things useful to spellcasters to find in the world. Particularly useful since this mod list makes sure spells cost a lot to buy from merchants!
* [**Fortify Magicka Regeneration**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54158?tab=files) by herbert  
Goes well with Proportional Magicka Regeneration -- and DRIP. Allows you to enchant things to restore magicka faster.
* [**Better Enchantments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47136) by Aracelliy  
Juggling cast-on-use enchantments annoys me. Apparently it annoyed Aracelliy as well, so she fixed it. 
* [**Consistent Enchanting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50029) by NullCascade  
Carries over unique item information, such as condition and script data when enchanting items.
* [**Enchantment Services Redone**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51249?tab=description) by Virnetch  
Adds NPC services for recharging enchanted items, deciphering magic scrolls and the option to transcribe magic scrolls, both by the player, and through a service. Adds empty scrolls from OAAB to enchanters and booksellers, and disables the passive recharging of enchanted items. Highly customizable through the Mod Config Menu.
* [**Smarter Strike Sounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51084) by NullCascade  
This mod improves the logic for selecting an enchantment failure sound. It enables selecting a random effect fail sound, and preventing the same enchantment from playing a sound twice (or more) in a row. As a result, enchantment strike sounds become a lot less spammy, and can provide some variety.
* [**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
Criminally underrated mod that adds a chance for filled soul gems to emit the cry of the creature they contain. Makes enchanters very spooky. 
* [**Smarter Soul Trap**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49121) by NullCascade  
Allows soultrap to make more intelligent use of available soul gems, including soul displacement and relocation. Includes optional leveling requirements. 
**Recommendation**: enable the optional level requirements. 


## Alchemy
* [**Poison Crafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729) by Greatness7  
Can now craft poisons and apply them to your weapons. Apparatus can be used in-world instead of having to be picked up. Certain types of NPC can now use poisons against you. 
* [**Restocking Alchemy Essentials**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232) by Sigourn  
Makes basic restore potions more widely available. 
**Recommendation:** Get the MWSE Poison Crafting patch as well.
* [**Magnitude of a Cure**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52419) by VitruvianGuar  
Blight diseases are meant to be really dangerous, but even unskilled alchemists can easily make a potion that will cure all of them. This mod makes cure potions work on percentage chances similar to Dispel effects, meaning you now have to be warier of diseases.
* [**Alchemical Knowledge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49036) by VitruvianGuar  
Improves the alchemy UI. 
* [**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade  
Prevents you from stacking loads of potions on top of each other by limiting how often you can drink them. Prevents you from cheesing every fight by carrying around 50 exclusive potions of restore health and drinking them all at once. Tactics required now!  

## Dialogue & Disposition & Special Events
* [**Greetings for NoLore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46063) by Caeris  
Adds 50+ generic greetings for no-lored NPCs, to prevent seeing the same three greetings on repeat.
* [**Real Disposition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51427) by PhoenixRime  
In vanilla, default disposition levels are actually fairly high, and you have to actively piss NPCs off to be refused services or hear any of Morrowind's large selection of low-disposition dialogue. This mod offers a few options for reducing base disposition so that Personality and Speechcraft and items enhancing those are more valuable. Having to bribe people into liking you is a good money sink. And sometimes, you'll have to go fend for yourself in the wilderness if you can't convince them to serve you. Great for certain character archetypes!  
I recommend the **base** preset, especially if you're also using rot's Racism.
* [**Django's Dialogue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47253) by von Djangos  
Hundreds of new lines of text dialogue for all NPCs, which helps to remedy the repetition and dialogue fatigue that came with the original game. The 1.4 update is mostly around greetings - new greetings by class, new greetings about your outfit and reputation, and fully filtered dialogue for weather and time of day
* [**What Thieves Guild**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47728) by von Djangos  
Adds realistic individual cover 'backgrounds' for thieves in the South Wall, The Rat in the Pot and Dirty Muriel's.
* [**What Thieves Guild - TR**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55410) by snackerfork  
Addon to "What Thieves Guild" that gives Thieves Guild NPCs throughout Tamriel Rebuilt cover stories, while making it more difficult to earn their trust than those on Vvardenfell.
* [**LDM - Context Matters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48273) by Lucevar  
Edits, re-filters, or adds on to vanilla dialogue to add more situational nuance - tavern owners will no longer talk about themselves in third person, Ashlanders will no longer curse vampires in the name of Almsivi, slave owners won't talk lovingly about abolitionists, and thieves will be less blase about incriminating themselves to strangers.
* [**Special Occasions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51156) by RedConversation  
A dialog mod about holidays and anniversaries. Adds the topic "special occasion" and date-sensitive greetings.
* [**Holidays Across Tamriel**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43131) by Lord Berandas  
This mod is inspired by holiday celebrations as they were depicted in TES II: Daggerfall. It adds various religion objects (such as holy icons or statues) to the most of Dunmeri homes and temples, in order to depict deeper impact of religion among the Dunmer people. It also "adds" holidays, during which some offerings are brought...
* [**HAT - TR Mainland**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55249) by callistofalling  
Adds the Holidays Across Tamriel holy icons and holiday celebrations to Morrowind mainland by Tamriel Rebuilt team.
* [**HAT - Lower Icon Prices**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50160) by Aralin  
This patch lowers the monetary value of the icons, statues, and offerings placed throughout Vvardenfell interiors by the mod Holidays across Tamriel. This is useful if you like to steal holy relics, but you don't want to unbalance the game by getting rich too fast.
* [**Where's Your Uniform**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55932) by TipsyTekPriest  
Expands the "Legion Uniform" script to include a greater roster of armours from Vanilla Morrowind and Tamriel_Data. Cuirasses, Helmets and Shields are all included to give the player character a greater range of options while still making sense in-setting.
* [**Raym's Vampire Rumours**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48469) by Raym  
Ever wanted to play as a vampire or maybe vampire hunter? Ever felt frustrated that pretty much your only chance to get informations on vampires was looking on the internet? This mod attempts to correct this by giving informations in game about vampire activities.
* [**Raym's Vampire Rumours - Patch for Purists Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48955?tab=files) by Alvazir  
Forwards a number of patches from PfP. 
* [**Outfit Greetings Tweaked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46066) by Anille  
Greetings regarding clothes are limited to clothiers, nobles and snooty High Elves. Now everyone will think your outfit is terrible, but only a few people will comment on it. 
* [**Caius Gives You A Cover Story**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50732) by RingComics  
Ever feel like you don't have any direction on what to do with your character before you're ready to tackle the main quest? With this mod, Caius will recommend you factions to join based on your skills the first time you ask about orders.

## Audio Dialogue
* [**SWIT**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54390) by Kildozery  
Adds tons of creative new insults. Goes great with all the disposition-lowering mods on this list. Now you really feel like outlander scum.
* [**SERA**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54396) by Kildozery  
But sometimes you can make friends! And they'll say even more nice things to you with this mod.
* [**FMI Not All Dunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569) by PoodleSandwich  
Not all Dunmer are slavers. Not all Argonians are slaves. Idle dialogue filtering has been improved to reflect this.
* [**FMI Nice to Meet You**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47329) by PoodleSandwich  
Tired of NPCs saying things like "Nice to meet you." after you've already met? Now they will say things like "Nice to see you." instead.
* [**FMI Michael Michael Michael**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48598) by PoodleSandwich  
Fixes Michael Mack's misreadings of the word "Dunmer".
* [**Idle Talk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46948) by von Djangos  
Adds over 200 new voice entries for NPCs. Members of rival houses will respond with hostility and suspicion. Members of your own will gradually respect you more. Legion, IC, and Temple all have some extra greetings. Tribunal audio is redistributed among regular Dunmer and Imperials where appropriate.  
* [**It's a Deal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47968) by Von Djangos and Petethegoat  
Shopkeepers will now comment with a line of voiced dialogue on a successful trade.
* [**Immersive Morrowind**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54513) by Von Djangos  
Adds several voiced conversations between NPCs around Vvardenfell. 
* [**Great Service**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47767) by von Djangos  
Enables voiced dialogue for shopkeepers that were shipped with the original game but never used.
* [**Quest Voice Greetings**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52273) by von Djangos  
Every major faction questgiver will ask you about the status of the quest you're on, tell you if they have no jobs left, and recognise you becoming head of the guild.
* [**Ashlander Voices**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53863) by von Djangos  
Adds 130 new voice greetings to the Ashlanders. The old 'Ashlander' voices beth used have been reassigned to the Telvanni, so it's sort of a Telvanni/Ashlander voice upgrade in one. Also has a quest!  
* [**Greet Distance Reducer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43994) by helswake  
NPCs will not shout at you as often when you walk by. (Sets the GMST iGreetDistanceMultiplier to 4.)
* [**Empty Threats Disabler**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44671) by rot  
Disables attack voices like "You will suffer greatly" on sneak kills or other instant deaths.
* [**Outlander Yourself**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674?tab=files) by rot  
Removes "outlander" from the voice lines of non-Dunmer NPCs.
* [**Nordic Banter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53715) by von Djangos  
Nord male smiths may comment on the weapon you have readied.
* [**Clothing Vocal Remarks Matter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55907) by lelimule  
NPCs who comment on your poor taste in clothing will now like you less each time you offend them with your choices.

## Environmental Hazards
* [**Leeches Always Bite Twice**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53010) by Melchior Dahrk, Greatness7, and Corsair  
Leeches now infest the waters and muck ponds of the Bitter Coast! You'll now think twice before wading through swamp gunk. Also comes with a fun detective quest.  
* [**Infectious Sewers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51062) by Spammer  
Ever thought it was weird how you can wander around sewers with no health issues? Now spending too much time in the sewers makes you sick.
* [**LW Regional Weather Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47224) by Lucevar  
Makes weather a bit moodier - more rain, more thunder, more fog.
* [**Heat Haze**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48973) by vtastek and tewlwolow  
Adds a heat haze shader with region and weather conditions. Hot things like lava really *look* hot now!
* [**Shattered Stones**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105) by R-zero  
Adds earthquakes to Morrowind. 
* [**Shattered Stones Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53125) by Publicola  
Expands Shattered Stones earthquakes to Red Mountain.  
* [**Mistify**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48112) by Melchior Dahrk  
This mod enhances the ambiance of the Bitter Coast by adding a new mist effect throughout region which appears during the night and certain weather conditions. It will burn off in the morning sun. The effect has been optimized to minimize performance impact. The mod also includes an optional replacer for the vanilla effect.
* [**The Great Scathes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52971) by RandomPal  
Adds pools of sulfur and geysers that erupt periodically. Very atmospheric.  
* [**Protective Helmets**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50280) by Virnetch  
Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet. This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms, such as Ashfall.  
* [**Wonders of Water**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52815) by NullCascade  
This mod attempts to make water react more to the world. When using MGE XE's water, different weathers will produce different wave heights. Water visibility also changes with depth, an effect that can be countered with Night Eye. Makes Night-Eye really useful, and underwater environments very hazardous. Standing on the shore during a storm is also a lot of fun with the big wave swell - it *feels* stormy!
* [**Dwemer Lightning Rods**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50236) by Melchior Dahrk  
With this mod, if you visit a dwemer ruin during a thunderstorm, you'll be greeted by blinding flashes as lightning strikes the steamstack lightning rods from the vanilla game. But be careful not to get too close lest you be shocked! 
* [**AURA**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48255) by tewlwolow  
Lua-based sound overhaul. Ambient sounds, interior weather, extended voices, and more. Compatible with TR/PT/SHotN. Easily customisable. Makes all sorts of environments more immersive -- towns more lively, bad weather audible even indoors, spookier tombs and caves.
* [**Impact Sounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52747) by Axemagister  
Hitting the environment with a weapon no longer does nothing! Depending on the material hit and the weapon used, a sound will play, damage will be done to the weapon, and in certain cases sparks may fly. Also includes a fully-rewritten version of Character Sound Overhaul, i.e. footstep sounds will react to the material of the landscape and statics beneath your feet, immersive inventory sounds, journal scribblings etc.
* [**Moving Minecarts**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53820) by Dillonn241  
Not a hazard as such, unless you count having too much fun as hazardous. Catch a ride on minecarts in 5 vanilla mines.

## Services
### Philosophy
* NPCs should refuse to serve you if doing so would put them in danger somehow.
* NPCs should react to disposition, your faction alignments, and current game state. Each playthrough should feel distinct depending on your build and choices, and visiting the settlements of enemy factions should feel more hostile.

### Mod Recs
* [**Hospitality Papers Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46107) by PoodleSandwich  
Makes Sadrith Mora feel very xenophobic. Now you really do need those Hospitality Papers to get any services in SM. Comes with custom voice acting by Jeff Baker!
* [**No Beds for the Diseased**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232) by Sigourn  
Prevents the player from renting beds if diseased, be it common, blight, or corprus disease. 
* [**Closed for the Night**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56054) by vaelta  
Travel NPCs (except guild guides) won't operate at night or in certain bad weathers. Traders mostly won't serve you at night. 
* [**Door Locks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54754) by abot  
Most doors will automatically lock at night. Depending on how much the inhabitants like you, faction affiliations, etc, they might open up if you knock. 
* [**Corprus Service Refusal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55816) by Sweezly  
Corprus is an incurable disease, and everyone is terrified of it. But you'd never know that in vanilla, where travel NPCs are happy to have you sit next to them on the silt strider for a few hours. With this mod, they react more appropriately, and refuse to take you. Your journey to Tel Fyr will feel more like the struggle it should be -- a lonely and isolated trek to the Corprusarium from which no-one ever re-emerges healthy. 
* [**Clear Your Name**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43786) by Lucevar  
In vanilla Morrowind, you have two options for clearing a bounty: turning yourself in to the guards or joining the Thieves Guild and paying them to make the problem go away. This mod adds more options, all RP friendly, to allow more character archetypes to access this service. The new options are balanced by either being difficult to access (locked behind high faction rank) or more expensive and inconvenient than taking the Thieves Guild option.
* [**LDM - Racist Service Refusal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50870) by Lucevar  
The Camonna Tong are a bunch of racist thugs who are... apparently completely happy to provide services to Argonians and Khajiit, regardless of disposition? Not any more! Now NPCs belonging to the Camonna Tong faction will refuse to provide services to Argonian (Race = 1) or Khajiit (Race = 6) player characters, unless you get them to a disposition of at least 90.
* [**Nerevarine Service Refusal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49528) by Rumeely  
Temple-aligned factions will refuse service at a certain point of the main quest.
* [**Redoran Freeloaders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47321) by Alice  
Sometimes you can catch a break! Redoran players sleep for free at the Flowers of Gold.  
* [**Exclusive Dronos Llervu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53383) by Lintergreen  
Restricts Dronos Llervu's (the smith at Ghostgate) services to high-ranking members of House Redoran and the Tribunal Temple. He's busy outfitting the folks protecting Morrowind from Dagoth Ur, why would he bother with random John Cyrodiil, the Fighter's Guild newest associate?

## Factions
### Philosophy
* The game should react to your faction choices.

### Mod Recs
* [**More Exclusive Factions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49618) by Lucevar and Alice  
Some factions will now refuse you membership if you have already joined other factions that they disapprove of. Others will make snarky comments or have you jump through some extra hoops if you're a member of a faction they dislike. NPCs will acknowledge choices you've already made, but only a few combinations are truly forbidden.
* [**Service Requirements Revised**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50715) by Lucas  
Factions are now much stricter about who they'll offer services to.
LuceNote: Make Telvanni a bit looser (eg SM merchants), maybe also lowest levels of HR. 
* [**Thieves Guild Magical Trickery**]() by Lucevar  
Adds Illusion, Alteration, Speechcraft and Mercantile to the list of faction skills for the Thieves Guild. Removes weapon and armour skills. Also adds a chance for scrolls of Ondusi's Unhinging and Ekash's Locksplitter to be sold by TG savant service npcs (the same ones who clear bounties.)

## Guards
* [**Sheathe Your Weapon - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53528) by von Djangos  
Guards will tell you to sheathe your weapon if you have it out. If you ignore their second warning, they'll attack.

## NPCs
* [**Onion - Layered Accesories**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50352) by Safebox  
Adds additional armour slots for accessories. Required by NOD.
* [**NOD - NPC Outfit Diversity**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52091) by Lucevar  
850 NPCs get unique and character/faction/race/class etc appropriate outfit upgrades.  
* [**Interesting Outfits - Kinsmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52167) by tipsytekpriest  
* [**Interesting Outfits - Ashlanders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54099) by tipsytekpriest  
* [**Interesting Outfits - Solstheim**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53124) by tipsytekpriest  
* [**Interesting Outfits - Cultists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51922) by tipsytekpriest  
* [**Interesting Outfits - Imperials**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53651) by tipsytekpriest  
* [**Interesting Outfits - TR Imperial Guards**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55776) by tipsytekpriest  
Highly atmospheric mod that makes NPC outfits much more varied and, well, interesting. IO is based on MDMD so along with their new outfits, NPCs will be generally more powerful and challenging. Load after NOD for best effect.
* [**Friends & Foes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49251) by Danae  
Adds a wide variety of random NPCs to meet all across Vvardenfell and PTR. Makes the world more dynamic.  
[**Friends & Frens**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52763) by Danae  
A large companion mod with 30+ brand new NPC companions, 40+ vanilla/TR npcs as companions and 20+ creature companions, and quests that connects them.

## Creatures
* [**Less Lame Leveled Spawns**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51059) by NullCascade  
If you've ever loaded a save game in a dungeon that you've cleared corpses in, you may have noticed them respawn. This fixes this issue, first by preventing the spawn during load, as well as adding a cooldown to leveled creature spawners.
* [**Beware the sixth house**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by mort  
* [**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort  
* [**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort  
Suite of three mods that rebalances creatures to something sane. Random wildlife on Solstheim are no longer god-killers. The Sixth House is now terrifyingly strong, proper end-game content. 
* [**Vanilla Friendly creatures and undeads expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48818) by RandomPal  
Compilation of vanilla-friendly creature mods, rebalanced and edited to work well together. Balanced to Mort's Rebalance suite.
**Recommendation**: Replace core with Kalinter's version below. Install 02 Daedric Creatures Use Bound Equipment. Ignore the other optional folders.
* [**Creatures_RP_Purist - Kalinter's Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53398) by Kalinter  
All the features from RP's mod, but adds more creatures from TD into Vvardenfell leveled lists, and reduces the cliff racer spawn rates for sanity's sake.  
* [**Tougher and More Unique Vanilla Monsters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52062) by DreadnaughtVCN   
Significant buffs for a number of enemies that were underwhelming in vanilla.
