[**Tamriel Rebuilt - Original Soundtrack**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47254) by Rytelier and ASKII  
Adds whole new soundtrack for Tamriel Rebuilt areas, with region based music, dungeons, cities and other. Requires [**MUSE 2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46200), or for you to remove the mp3s from their folders and put them in Music/Explore or Music/Battle.  
[**Additional Music Project**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28951/) by EvilBlueKoala  
Download the mp3s from the optional files section and put them in Music/Explore or Music/Battle. The main download uses a different file format that Morrowind can't read.
