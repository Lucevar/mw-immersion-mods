This is a list of (hopefully) all the caves and dungeons in Morrowind (+ Tribunal and Bloodmoon, at the bottom) separated by category. Next to the name of the cave is a list of mods that change it. Some mods change a lot of different caves; in that case I've generally just abbreviated the name rather than linking it every time. These include:  

[**Remiros' Tombs Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45616) by *Remiros* - Abbreviated as **RTE**  
[**Mines & Caverns**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44893) by *jsp25* - Abbreviated as **M&C**  
[**Mines & Caverns - Solstheim**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45470) by *jsp25* - Abbreviated as **M&CS**, only compatible with Wollibeebee's Tomb of the Snow Prince, not with vanilla. Use LCO's Solstheim changes if you don't use TOTSP.
[**Detailed Dungeons**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45076) by *Eldermaster28* - Abbreviated as **DD**.  
[**Cavern Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42249) by *Lougian* - Abbreviated as **LCO**  
[**Dwemer Rebirth Project**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45249) by *RubberMan* - Abbreviated as **DRP**  

**If you're aware of any mods that change these locations but aren't listed here, please let me know! I can be contacted as Lucevar at the Morrowind Nexus or on the Morrowind Modding Discord (linked above)**.

## TL;DR my recommendations
Details coming soon - but M&C and LCO conflict. I'd recommend using **M&C** with the DD patch (available on the M&C page) since I think the changes M&C makes are generally higher quality, with fewer compatibility issues. Then use **RTE** and **DRP** on top.

## <a name="replacers"></a>General Replacers
**[Lougian's Caverns Bumpmapped](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42412)** - This texture replacer makes such an incredible difference to the cave experience just on it's own. Requires MCP's Bumpmapping option to be enabled, otherwise you get odd texture results. It's a texture replacer so it's compatible with pretty much all the other mods on this list.  

## <a name="new"></a>New Dungeons
[**Serpenthis Ancestral Tomb**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45701) by *Lord Berandas* - this is a fun new dungeon with some interesting gameplay. Hope you enjoyed Sabrina's gym as a kid!  

[**Dreadful Cavern**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46046) by *Lady Eternity* - adds a new cavern near Sadrith Mora.  

[**Mage Robes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45739) by *Melchior Dahrk*  
Doesn't sound dungeon related to begin with, but there's a beautiful new cave system added for the quest in this mod.  

[**OAAB Tel Mora**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46177) by *Melchior Dahrk*  
Adds an interesting new dungeon as part of quests added to Tel Mora, as well as being a beautiful town expansion.  

[**Expedition to Mzelthuand**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45229) by *Greatness7, TheDrunkenMudcrab, and Melchior Dahrk*   
Off the shoreline of the Bitter Coast region, a Dwemer Ruin has appeared. Take up your spells and delve into the deepest and darkest of Dwemer mysteries within an enigmatic study facility that holds far more than it lets on. Beautiful level design and interesting rewards and quests.  

[**Sotha Sil Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42347) by *Team SSE*  
"Sotha Sil was somewhat disappointing in vanilla Tribunal, so we've made a massive expansion that creates the Clockwork City as it was always meant to be. A sprawling dungeon, a topsy-turvy city, and the madness of the Clockwork God all stand to challenge you!" - a vast expansion to Tribunal's Sotha Sil, with extensive new dungeons and quests.  

[**Of Dungeons and Abodes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44253) by *Darkelfguy*

To the west of Seyda Neen, along the bitter coast, there lives a hermit by the name of Thexn Akaasul. It would seem that Thexn has a series of tasks for any adventurous soul willing to seek him out, though they deal mostly with the necessities of life rather than adventures of the grandiose sort.  

[**Of Justice and Innocence**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/34046) by *Darkelfguy*  
In the small village of Dagon Fel there lives a woman by the name of Rinida Honwyer. She claims her poor, sweet innocent brother has been kidnapped by smugglers. This unfortunate outcome is a result of an unlikely series of events and her poor brother's own naivety. Now Rinida fears for her brothers life, sure that these smugglers mean nothing but harm towards him.

[**Dungeon & Diamond**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-68-6874) by *Arcimaestro Antares*  
In Sadrith Mora, behind the Dirty's Muriel Corner Club, there is a trapdoor to a new dungeon. New creatures, traps, and a unique diamond, await you. It was designed for a master thief character (level 20+), that should retrieve the diamond as proof he/she deserved the title, but then only a few ones could play the mod. So, the dungeon can be accessed by anyone. If you levitate in the dungeon, you'll miss most of the traps (and the fun).  

[**Ruins of Serpenthold**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42579) by *The Undying One*
