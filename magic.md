## Spells & Magicka
### Attributes 
* [**Putting Power in Willpower**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742) by R-Zero  
Willpower is described as affecting your abilities to resist spells, but in vanilla it is bugged and doesn't work. This mod enables it, for PCs and NPCs.  

### Magic Pool
* [**Skill Based Magicka Increase**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51286) by RogiVagel18  

### Magicka Regen, Spell Cost, and XP
* [**Mastering Magicka**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42269) by dopeyFish  
* [**Purist Friendly Magicka Regen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45636) by Remiros & Greatness7  
* [**MWSE Strategic Magicka Regen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50008) by Unappendixed  
Adds magicka regeneration that scales with both willpower and your current magicka percentage. Mostly full magicka pools will regenerate almost immediately--dip further into your reserves and it will take exponentially longer to naturally replenish.
* [**Magicka-Based Skill Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330) by JaceyS  
Spell casting skills advance based on the amount of Magicka spent, rather than the number of spell casts.
* [**CCCP Magicka Regen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51143) by Necrolesian  

### Spells
* [**Magicka Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111) by OperatorJack and RedFurryDemon

* [**Player Made Magic Rename**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51484) by abot  
* [**Sensible Starting Spells**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51574) by Randolph Carter  

### Spell Visuals (general)

* [**Elemental Projectile Hits - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51149) by Spammer  

### Alchemy
* [**Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599) by Stuporstar and Greatness7  
* [**MWSE Alchemy Takes Time (inpv edit)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50446) by inpv  
Alchemical process now takes time, based on potion's value and player's skill. The better the potion and the lower the skill, the longer it'll take to brew it.  
* [**Skoomaesthesia**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49920) by Merlord and XeroFoxx  
Adds new skooma mechanics including animated skooma pipe smoking, psychedelic shaders and sound effects, and skooma addiction.
* [**Alchemical Knowledge**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49036) by VitruvianGuar  
MWSE-lua mod, which fixes gameplay and interface inconsistencies in alchemy menu, provides it with built-in effect filter and implements Skyrim-like system for remembering ingredient effects.
* [**Visible Alchemy Success Chance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48608) by skmrSharma  
A simple, pluginless mod that displays the percentage success chance in potion making.
* [**MWSE Alchemy Filter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44808) by Greatness7  
You can now filter ingredients based on their effects.  
* [**Poison Crafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729) by Greatness7  
Adds a new poison mechanic similar to Oblivion and Skyrim's. NPCs can use poison as well! Also allows you to use apparatus in-world rather than having to pick it up and use it from your inventory, and a new alchemy mode where better apparatus decreases positive effects rather than negative so you can craft your own poisons.  
* [**Auto Harvest**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51159) by Krimson  
Auto Harvest will automatically collect ingredients from organic containers, and loose ingredients within range of the player.
Compatible with Graphic Herbalism and Tamriel Rebuilt.  
* [**Poisoner**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51240) by Revacholiere  
A complement to the many poison mods released - this one more focused on stealthily applying poison to your targets, rather than putting poison on your weapon.
* [**Tools of the Secret Master**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51415) by Necrolesian  
Adds Secret Master lockpicks, probes, and alchemy apparatus to the game.
* [**Alchemy - Multiple Potions at Once - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51461) by Spammer  
Allows you to brew multiple potions at once (OpenMW style). No more need to torture your poor left mouse button to get 20 restore fatigue potions.

### Alteration
* [**The Levitation Act**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47345) by OperatorJack and Alice93  
"3E 421 â€” The Levitation Act is passed throughout the Empire, outlawing the use of levitation magic."  
This mod makes it so that performing a levitation spell is illegal, as it is supposed to be according to The Levitation Act. Performing a levitation spell or using a levitation enchantment and being caught while doing so will give you a bounty of 500 gold per levitation effect, per cast! However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a levitation spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone. This functionality does not apply to NPCs and creatures.
* [**Chrysopoeia**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47008) by OperatorJack  
Using MWSE Lua and Magicka Expanded, embark on a short quest to gain the power of transmuting items into gold: Chrysopoeia. Search for the most learned alchemist on the island of Morrowind to find it. But, remember, nothing is free.
* [**Better Buoyancy**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48929) by OperatorJack  
This mod adds new controls for swimming and levitating. Use the jump key to float upwards, and the sneak key to sink downwards.
* [**MM - Enhanced Reflection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48956) by OperatorJack  
This mod adds reflection mechanics to the Reflect, Shield, Fire Shield, Shock Shield, and Frost Shield magic effects for both the Player and NPCs.
* [**Shield Spells Reforged**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50073) by Kurpulio  
Visual overhaul of Elemental Shield spells, with additional on-hit effects
* [**Wings of Will**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626) by sataniel  
In the base game, the levitation speed is based on the Speed attribute. This never made much sense to me. You can levitate faster by being a great runner? Now levitation is based on the Willpower attribute (just as the Alteration skill is) with other calculations remaining the same.
* [**Sorcerer of Alteration**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51224) by kindi  
Journey through this quest mod to improve your alteration magic.
* [**Spells Reforged - Shield**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50905) by Greatness7 - Kurpulio  
Replaces Shield spell visual effect.

### Conjuration
* [**Atronach Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22189) by Melchior Dahrk  
This mod takes several community resources as well as Melchior's own work and adds seven new types of monsters as summonable creatures: Bone Golem, Flesh Atronach, Iron Golem, Swamp Myconid, Telvanni Myconid, Ash Golem, Crystal Golem

New conjuration spell to command your army of weapons.
* [**Bound Spells Reforged**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48750) by Kurpulio 
Visual overhaul of Bound Spells.  
* [**Bound Ammo**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50766) by Yorklag  
Adds a Bound Ammunition spell. 
* [**Bound to Balance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48563) by OEA  
Bound weapons' damage and bound armor's AR scales with Conjuration or Willpower. Only affects vanilla and Magicka Expanded bound items.  
* [**Bestow Binding**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49084) by Merzasphor  
Enables on touch, on target, and area effect bound item spells.
* [**Illegal Summoning**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105) by OperatorJack  
Using MWSE Lua, this mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Applies to the player, NPCs, and creatures.
* [**Summon Creature Followers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51246) by Krimson  
Vanilla and TR versions. Tired of the same 17 summon creatures in the game? This adds 90 creature followers that are able to be summoned with a custom menu. Multiple options in a MCM menu
* [**Nimrod's Bound Armor Lite**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51257) by Nimrod  
Adds conjurable greaves and pauldrons in the most vanilla-like manner possible. This version does NOT require MWSE and can be used with OpenMW.
* [**Obedient Summons - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51472) by Spammer  
Allows you to give basic orders to your summoned creatures. Adds a new spell, called "Soul Release", allowing you to summon a soul trapped in a soulgem. You can now have Vivec or Almalexia as obedient summons! Requires Magicka Expanded.
* [**Disobedient Summons - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51483) by Spammer  
Summonned Creatures will be more enclined to take sides with whoever has the highest conjuration skill. Which means that you'll have a chance to steal hostile NPCs summons if your conjuration is high enough, but also that your own summons might turn against you if you send them against the wrong opponent.

### Destruction
* [**Elemental Magicka II**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42106) by NMZMaster  
Adds many new spells with unique visual effects.  
* [**Elemental Effects**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49799) by Anumaril  
Applies visual effects to both NPCs and the player when damaged by fire, frost, shock, poison, or sun spell effects.
* [**Farhrenheit 451 - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51294) by Spammer  
Ever dreamt of becoming an arsonist? This mod is for you.

### Enchant
* [**Magical Mechanics - Cast-on-Swing Enchantments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47338) by OperatorJack
Another entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, weapons with enchantments of Cast-On-Strike and Cast-On-Use types will now work without hitting a target. Just swing your weapon and the enchantment will work as normal, sending a spell projectile towards your target.

Carries over unique item information, such as condition and script data when enchanting items.  
* [**Disenchant**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48111) by Unappendixed  
Adds a spell to disenchant enchanted items, whether they're player enchanted or from the base game. No more hesitating to enchant those daedric boots you found because your enchant skill isn't high enough for a suitably powerful effect. Requires MWSE.
* [**Better Enchantments**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47136) by Aracelliy  
 Improves many enchants in the game by replacing Cast On Use with Constant Effect variants. But with discretion and rebalancing some unique enchants. 
 * [**Cantrips**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46657) by Danae  
Adds scrolls to the leveled lists (books and scrolls) that teach cantrips to the magically challenged. Cantrips never fail but cost a lot more magicka and don't improve your skills. Adept spellcaster cannot (will not) use cantrips. 
* [**MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554) by svengineer99  
Adds new services to enchanters, including the ability to recharge enchanted items and making additional copies of scrolls.  
* [**Random Enchantment Encounters Expanded Enhanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47915) by Stripes  
Adds new enchanted items to leveled lists

* [**Cursed Item Random Summon**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48142) by Eq  
Picking up a cursed item will spawn a variety of daedra
* [**Assetless No-Glow**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47925) by NullCascade  
Pluginless *and* assetless no-glow. Use less memory, get some frames back, and be more compatible!
* [**Controlled Weapon Enchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50142) by Kurpulio and Axemagister  
'Cast When Strikes' weapon enchants will only release a charge when wanted, controlled by toggle on/off button.
* [**Enchant Drain - MWSE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51124) by Spammer  
Adds a buyable spell called "Enchant Drain", that allows you to use your enchanted staves and amulets as a supplementary mana pool for the duration of the spell.  
* [**Cast on Hit Bows Lua**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51196) by Krimson  
Makes any arrow/bolt shot from any bow/crossbow hit with the bows cast on use or cast on strike enchantment.
* [**Enchantment Services Redone - ESR**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51249) by Virnetch  
Adds NPC services for recharging enchanted items, deciphering magic scrolls and the option to transcribe magic scrolls, both by the player, and through a service. Adds empty scrolls from OAAB to enchanters and booksellers, and disables the passive recharging of enchanted items. Highly customizable through the Mod Config Menu.
 
### Illusion
* [**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Invisibility**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565) by OperatorJack, Kurpulio, Vtastek  
Using invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Also, under the effect of invisibility, Daedra and undead creatures will seem... different.
* [**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Light**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47672) by OperatorJack  
The light magic effect has been replaced with a Skyrim-style magelight effect. Using the new magelight effect creates an orb of light that will follow and float around you and other NPCs. Casting the magelight on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell.
* [**Charming Has Consequences (MWSE)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50473) by KirbonatedBeverage  
Makes charm effects incur a bounty after they wear off.  
* [**Mabo's Foundations**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47244) by Meta Barj0  
Not a mod per se, but a framework that is necessary for other MAB0's mods to work
* [**Mabo's Manipulated**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47222) by Meta Barj0  
This mod makes all mental manipulation effect count as an aggression. Player will be fine if witnessed using one of these effects.
* [**Vanish From Sight**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51266) by inpv  
As long as the player is invisible, all hostiles located in the current cell stop combat. Includes configurable fight values for hostiles in MCM. A must-have for any illusionist.

* [**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Telekinesis**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47534) by OperatorJack & Kurpulio  
This mod is inspired by Fliggerty's Better Telekinesis. Using telekinesis will now propel objects towards you with new VFX instead of immediately picking the item up.  
* [**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Detection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47480) by OperatorJack, RedFurryDemon, Kurpulio  
This mod adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors. It does all of this without requiring an ESP.
* [**Limited Recall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48438) by Necrolesian  
This configurable MWSE mod allows you to limit the casting of Recall in various ways.
* [**Teleportation Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49119) by Mag4152

* [**Limited Intervention**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46687) by Merlord

* [**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
Adds a chance for soul gems to emit a sound from the creature whose soul they contained. Very atmospheric. *Very* creepy.
