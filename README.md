# Morrowind Themed Mod Lists - 2019 Edition
**Updated**: 2019/05/04

There are a number of fairly up to date graphics guides for Morrowind, but for many years now there hasn't really been a collection of *themed* mod lists. This page hopes to change that.

This is very much a collaborative project - if you think of a mod that fits the theme of one of these lists that I haven't included, please submit a pull request or send me a PM on the Morrowind Modding Discord or on the Morrowind Nexus (username: Lucevar). I can't promise to include every suggestion, but I will always consider it!
