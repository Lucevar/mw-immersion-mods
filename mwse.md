# MGE/MWSE Mods List
**Updated**: 2022/02/12

First grab [**MGE XE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102), then run MWSE-update.exe, and get the [**Morrowind Code Patch (MCP)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510) for good measure.  

This isn't a list of recommendations - it attempts to catelogue MWSE and MGE mods. Unless otherwise stated I don't vouch for quality or compatibility.  

If a mod requires both MGE and MWSE I usually categorise it under MWSE.

[**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Light**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47672) by OperatorJack, Greatness7 and Kurpulio  
The light magic effect has been replaced with a Skyrim-style magelight effect. Using the new magelight effect creates an orb of light that will follow and float around you and other NPCs. Casting the magelight on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell.  

[**Restrictive Saving**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47584) by Anumaril21  
Restrictive Saving is a simple, configurable immersion and challenge mod that allows saving only when resting, once a day, forbids saving altogether, or prevents the player from saving under a number of other conditions.  

[**Pickpocket**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47581) by Mort  
Adds a custom real-time menu to pickpocketing and restores a formerly-useless mechanic.

[**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Invisibility**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565) by OperatorJack, Kurpulio & Vtastek  
 Using invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Also, under the effect of invisibility, Daedra and undead creatures will seem... different.

[**Ajira's Alchemy Reports Randomizer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47550) by Danae and Merlord  
Look for Ajira's stolen reports once again: their location changes every time.  

[**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Telekinesis**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47534) by OperatorJack & Kurpulio  
This mod is inspired by Fliggerty's Better Telekinesis. Using telekinesis will now propel objects towards you with new VFX instead of immediately picking the item up.  

[**Realistic Sun Damage**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47540) by OperatorJack  
This mod adds a +/- 50% random modifier to the sun damage calculation. It doesn't make sense that sun damage is a constant value for the given time and weather, as clouds and coverage can change. It does not modify the sun damage formula in any other way. So, for example, if the vanilla sun damage calculation returns 4, the new calculation could return 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.  

[**Class Description Tooltip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47527) by Merlord  
This mod restores the class description tooltip to the class selection menu. In vanilla, the class description can only be read from the stats menu after you have already selected a class. Adding it back to the class selection menu makes it easier to decide which class you want to go with.  

[**Summon Creeper**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47510) by CaptainCanti  
This mod utilizes MWSE and OperatorJack's Magicka Expanded framework to add a spell called "Summon Creeper" that, as the name implies, allows you to summon the scamp merchant residing in Ghorak Manor in Caldera.  

[**Magical Mechanics - Enhanced Detection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47480) by OperatorJack, RedFurryDemon, Kurpulio  
This mod adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors. It does all of this without requiring an ESP.

[**Smart Journal**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47492) by abot  
Adds several new options for journal pages and quests list, including extra support for mod-added quests.

[**Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47452) by mort  
A fully customizable leveling mod that removes the level-up screen entirely. Never worry about min/maxing skill ups ever again. The functionality of GCD/MADD, but fully customizable and conflict-free. Play how you want, and leave leveling to the MULE.

# New Nov 1 - Dec 23, 2019
[**Harder Merchants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47416) by Corsair83  
Harder Merchants is a simple, but effective mod, that forces merchant's mercantile skill to grow as the player increases in level; removing the static nature of their stat, and thus making it much more of a challenge when bartering with them. Used in conjunction with Harder Barter player's can expect to have a more difficult time trying to buy/sell their ill-gotten goods; severely decreasing the chances of "get rich, quick" play throughs. Together, they can serve as a modern replacement for older mods, such as HotFusion's Economy Adjuster, which did something similar with NPC's mercantile skill, but now with far less lines of code.

[**Armor Auto-Balancer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47325) by Siltocyn  
Pluginless mwse-lua armor rebalancer using properties based on hollaajith's Armor Overhaul.

"3E 421 — The Levitation Act is passed throughout the Empire, outlawing the use of levitation magic."  
This mod makes it so that performing a levitation spell is illegal, as it is supposed to be according to The Levitation Act. Performing a levitation spell or using a levitation enchantment and being caught while doing so will give you a bounty of 500 gold per levitation effect, per cast! However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a levitation spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone. This functionality does not apply to NPCs and creatures.  

[**Anchor Teleportation**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47413) by OperatorJack  
This mod makes mark and recall behave like in Daggerfall. Whenever you use recall, the location you have marked will be lost and you must cast mark again, creating an "anchor".  

[**Magical Mechanics - Homing Projectiles**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47403) by OperatorJack  
 Adds the ability to control spell projectiles during flight.

[**Smart Ammo**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47383) by abot

[**Player-Only Speed Walk and Sprint**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47323) by iLiveOnFear  
This mod adds faster walking (running), sprinting, and gives you 3 options in stamina drain from running. The walking speed boost you get affects you only, and the boost is dependent on Athletics. Sprinting is boosted by both Athletics and Agility. Benefits of the boost end at lvl 100, but you can still become faster by leveling up Speed. Higher athletics also means more efficient sprinting. The sprint key is bound to "Left Shift".

[**100 Percent Hit and Cast Rate by All**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47326) by iLiveOnFear  
Changes Hitrate to 100% for both the player, NPC, and enemies using MWSE. This makes weapon skills obsolete, so keep that in mind. Optional: Changes Spell Cast Rate to 100%. Again, it's for both the player, NPC, and enemies. This makes magic skills useless.

[**Tamriel Rebuilt - Original Soundtrack**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47254) by Rytelier and ASKII  
Adds whole new soundtrack for Tamriel Rebuilt areas, with region based music, dungeons, cities and other. Requires [**MUSE 2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46200) 

[**Regional Bounty**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47285) by Sushi

[**Bardic Inspiration**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45441) by Merlord  
This mod uses MWSE to dynamically replace all lutes and fat lutes in the game with equippable versions. Equipping these in a tavern after 6pm will allow you to perform any one of 10 pieces, during which you will earn gold. You can also perform music when outdoors, which provides a buff to fatigue recovery.

[**Realistic Movement Speeds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46248) by OperatorJack  
This mod uses MWSE Lua to modify movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important. These changes automatically apply to the player and any NPCs / Creatures (modded or vanilla) without using a plugin or altering your savegame.

A set of MGE XE shaders tweaked to work well with the [Morrowind Graphic Guide](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Morrowind_graphics_guide).

[**3rd Person Camera Transitions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46230/) by darksatanas

Quest mod. On a strange island known to few as Crescent Moon Isle, a bloodbath awaits the player in a struggle for survival against a band of crazed assassins, all for the amusement of a few cultists hiding away in the shadows. Partake in the slaughter with joy, or perhaps you believe in following the deity's actual wishes, hidden among the bodies... Part of MMM 2018.  

[**MWSE Unique Item Tooltips**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46122/) by anumaril21  
Provides helpful tooltips/flavor texts for all Quest Items, Unique Items, and some Artifacts within Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, and the Official Plugins.  

[**MWSE Key Tooltips**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46109/) by anumaril21  
Provides helpful tooltips/flavor texts to all Keys and Propylon Indices within Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, and the Official Plugins.

[**Loading Doors Lock Tune**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46094) by abot  
Automatically tunes linked doors locked/unlocked state on activate, lock/unlock by spell, unlock by lockpick. Tuned doors are not only coherent, they should work great with mods like pursuit enhanced allowing NPCs to chase you through doors and give a purpose to the lock spell.

[**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069) by Greatness7 & community modellers  
Equipped weapons no longer disappear when lowered. Instead they will be shown on the character's hip or back. This new functionality affects both the player and all other characters, and works with all weapons from all mods. Additionally features a comprehensive set of high quality quiver and scabbard assets.  

[**UI Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071/?) by NullCascade  
Expands UI functionality with searching, filtering, and more visual feedback.  

[**Skills Module**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034) by Merlord  
Skills Module is a framework for MWSE+Lua mods that allows you to easily create new skills in Morrowind with just a few lines of code. Leveling and UI are handled automatically, with new skills added seamlessly into the stats menu.  

[**Immersive Mining**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46041) by Merlord  
Mine ore by actually swinging a pick axe at it. Uses latest MWSE+Lua

Quickly create province-specific battle and explore soundtracks for Tamriel Rebuilt (Mainland Morrowind) and Project Tamriel's province mods (Cyrodiil and Skyrim) by dragging and dropping music into folders.  

## MWSE-Lua (2.1+)
[**Speed and Movement Rebalanced**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46029/) by Remiros  
This mod rebalances the speed attribute and overall movement in the game in an attempt to make it feel more natural. See the mod page for a full list of changes. There is an optional new sprinting mechanic added that requires MWSE - the base mod does not.

[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Aka Modder's Delight. Even with the Code Patch Morrowind often crashes on exit, requiring you to kill the process in task manager just to get out of it. It's an irritating waste of time when you're playing, and even worse when you're testing mods and quitting Morrowind 10+ times an hour. This mod squashes that crash, making exiting as quick and easy as it always should have been.  

[**Happy Harvesting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45627) by NullCascade  
A simple mod that auto-loots plants when you activate them, instead of opening it as a container. Compatible with mod added plants as well. It doesn't affect scripted plants, so it's compatible with mods like Graphic Herbalism, which simply override Happy Harvesting.  

[**Sophisticated Save System**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45608) by NullCascade  
Drastically expands and improves the save system, including autosaves on cell changes. No more playing for hours, crashing, and then realising that your last save was three hours and ten quests back!  

[**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade  
Changes the mechanics of how many potions a player can drink. In vanilla, the player is allowed to drink infinite potions with no negative effects, leading to easy alchemy exploits. Offers two options: limit the player to one potion per five seconds, or an Oblivion-style option that allows the player to have only four potions active at once.  

[**Dynamic Difficulty**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45710) by NullCascade  
Configurable difficulty. You can change the base difficulty, make the game harder or easier as you level up, or set the difficulty per region (so you could make the Bitter Coast very easy but the Ashlands much more dangerous, for example).  

[**Easy Escort**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712) by NullCascade  
Vanilla escort quests are a nightmare because of the terrible pathfinding AI. This mod keeps followers close to you and ensures they don't get stuck on a rock in the ashlands somewhere.  

[**Diligent Defenders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45717) by NullCascade  
When combat begins, your companions will start to defend you immediately, instead of waiting for you to be attacked first. A real lifesaver if that enemy is going to kill you in one hit and you can't afford to wait!  

[**Proportional Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45697) by NullCascade  
Allows you to easily adjust the progression rate to make leveling skills slower/faster, based on a number of different factors.  

[**Memory Monitor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696) by NullCascade  
Provides an in-game alert if you're close to reaching the 4GB memory limit, so that you can save and restart in time to prevent a crash.  

[**Permanently Perished**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45672) by NullCascade  
Adds an optional permadeath mechanic. When you start a new game, you'll be asked how many lives your character gets (defaulting to 1; you can choose not to use permadeath on any given save). Once your lives are used up, you can no longer load that character's saves, and attempting to will start a new game instead.  

[**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
Adds a chance for soul gems to emit a sound from the creature whose soul they contained. Very atmospheric. *Very* creepy.  

[**Poison Crafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729) by Greatness7  
Adds a new poison mechanic similar to Oblivion and Skyrim's. NPCs can use poison as well! Also allows you to use apparatus in-world rather than having to pick it up and use it from your inventory, and a new alchemy mode where better apparatus decreases positive effects rather than negative so you can craft your own poisons.  

[**Lights Fix for Vtastek's PPL shaders**]() by Greatness7  

[**Glow in the Dahrk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886) by Melchior Dahrk & NullCascade  
The most up-to-date and feature rich version of Windows Glow. Includes much more subtle and aesthetically pleasing windows glow, randomly spaced lighting so not every window turns on precisely at dusk and off precisely at dawn, and automatic compatibility with mods using vanilla meshes (such as Tamriel Rebuilt). No more need for infinite patches just to make your windows light up!  

[**Brutal Backstabbing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45890) by Merlord  
Do more damage when stabbing an enemy from behind (NPCs can also backstab - beware turning your back!).  

[**Automated Ammo Equip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45845) by Merlord  
Ever want to use both crossbows and regular bows, but get annoyed at having to remember to switch ammo type? This automates it for you.  

[**Frostwind**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45654) by Merlord  
The immersion and survival mod to end all others. Similar to (and inspired by) the Skyrim mod *Frostfall*, it adds weather exposure, hunger, tiredness, and thirst mechanics, while aiming to reward sensible travellers rather than punish bad micromanagement - which makes it, in my experience, much less tedious to play with than any other needs mod.  

[**Magnum Menu Textures**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45859) by Petethegoat  
Improved main menu buttons, with support for MWSE's Mod Configuration Menu.  

[**Pete's Lua GMST config**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45818) by Petethegoat  
Allows you to set GMSTs without having to use an .esp slot - and allows you to hot reload them in game for testing purposes.  

[**Torch Hotkey**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747) by Remiros  
Adds 'C' as a dedicated hotkey for light sources. Pressing C will equip/unequip the first light source in your inventory, prioritising lights that have already been used. It will also re-equip previously equipped shields, two-handed weapons and ranged weapons. Super convenient!  

[**Lucky Strike**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45765) by R-Zero  
Adds a luck based critical strike mechanic similar to Daggerfall. Works for PCs and NPCs.  

[**Plaguebearer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45760) by R-Zero  
Enables the transfer of diseases from PCs to NPCs. Now you can be the Nurgling you always wanted to be!  

[**Putting Power in Willpower**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742) by R-Zero  
Willpower is described as affecting your abilities to resist spells, but in vanilla it is bugged and doesn't work. This mod enables it, for PCs and NPCs.  

[**Time Flies!**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45727) by cptjoker  
In vanilla Morrowind, time is frozen while you're in a menu, such as the dialogue window or while reading a book. This mod makes time pass while you're in those menus. Now if you spend all night talking to Hassour Zainsubani about Ashlander customs, it really does take all night!  

[**Vaba-Amus Companion Character**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45711) by TheDrunkenMudcrab  
Adds a drunken scrib to Suran, just outside Desele's. If you choose to talk to him, you'll be in for some wacky and hilarious adventures - that fit in to lore surprisingly well.  

[**MWSE Alchemy Filter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44808) by Greatness7  
You can now filter ingredients based on their effects.  

[**MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554) by svengineer99  
Adds new services to enchanters, including the ability to recharge enchanted items and making additional copies of scrolls.  

[**MWSE2.1 Sky Diversity Auto Launch Add On**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45600) by svengineer99  
Autolaunches Sky Diversity so you don't have to remember to do it manually every time you want to play.  

[**The Forgotten**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45733) by Team Horny Skulls  
A quest mod dealing with a cult of Namira, with options to side with the cultists or the ordinators.  

[**Invisibility Anti-Exploit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45899) by Remiros, Greatness7, and NullCascade  
In the vanilla game invisibility has a relatively major bug/exploit. While you are invisible and not directly in the line of sight of an NPC, the sneak chance will always be 100%, even if your sneak, agility and luck are as low as 0, which pretty much allows you to steal absolutely everything. This has to do with the fact that the AI doesn't update quickly enough after exiting invisibility. This mod fixes this by preemptively removing the invisibility effect and delaying the activate function by a single frame.  

[**Dimensional Containers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45883) by ProfArmitage  
Adds four magical portable containers hidden across Vvardenfell that can hold far more than their size suggests and never increase in weight. They're quite heavy but allow you to carry more overall - if you can find them and get through the dungeons. Rumours in towns will give you vague hints.  

[**Configurable Barter Gold**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45942) by DarkholmeTenk  
This mod adds a new setting to the Mod Configuration menu added by the latest version of MWSE which allows you to set a multiplier to every merchant's gold amounts. If you think NPCs generally have too much or too little gold you can adjust it now.  

[**Ownership Indicator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45940) by Petethegoat  
Ownership Indicators adds an Oblivion style ownership indicator, when you look at owned items, beds, and more. Compatible with all crosshair texture replacements. Uses Lua instead of old MWSE/MGE functions as previous ownership indicators have.  

[**Immersive Run Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45947/) by Petethegoat  
This mod normalizes the player's movement speed, ensuring they run at a consistent speed even during diagonal movement.

[**Continue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45952/) by Petethegoat  
Adds a continue button to the main menu, to instantly load your most recent save. This can also optionally hide the credits button to stop the main menu from becoming too cluttered. This also includes a secret testing feature to load into a specified save game even faster- uncomment two of the lines at the top of main.lua, and choose a filename and key code. Instantly load into a save by holding your key while the game starts up. Several menu texture replacers have compatibility options for this.  

[**Tamrielic Lore Tooltips**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45954/?tab=description) by PhDInSorcery  
Tamrielic Lore is an in-game book describing the stories behind each artifact the player encounters in Vvardenfell. This mod adds the book's lore to the tooltips of each respective artifact. Note that this mod does not actually change the items themselves; it uses MWSE-Lua to add onto their tooltips. It is therefore compatible with everything!  

[**Value/Weight Ratios on Tooltips**](http://abitoftaste.altervista.org/morrowind/index.php?option=downloads&task=info&id=97&Itemid=50&-Value-Weight-Ratio-Tooltip) by abot  
Displays the Value to Weight ratio on item tooltips so you can see at a glance if an item is worth taking or not.  

[**Tooltip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45969) by abot  
An updated version of previous Value/Weight Ratio mod (renamed from ValueWeightRatio to Tooltip as functionality may increase. By default displays Value/Weight Ratio, you can change setting below in main.lua file to true or false to enable extra functionality. You can also enable showing whether or not a skill book has already been read.  

[**Ingredient Flavour Texts**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45956/) by Remiros  
This mod adds flavor texts to all ingredients in the game, expansions included. Like Tamrielic Lore Tooltips this should be compatible with everything since it doesn't edit the objects themselves.  

[**Get Lost!**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45981?) by NullCascade  
Removes the minimap and the world map, for maximum immersion. Better find a compass and a paper map!  

[**Equipment Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45980) by Remiros and Greatness7  
This mod adds skill requirements for all armors and weapons in the vanilla game, its expansions and all mods mentioned in the last section. The requirements are directly based on the skill of the respective item.  

[**Dahrk's Super-Sized Storage (D'sSSS)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45147) by Melchior Dahrk  
This simple mod increases the capacity of all containers (BM and TR included) by x100. Zero capacity containers are unaltered (0*100=0). For instance, crates in the original game had a weight capacity of 200. By applying this mod, they will be able to hold 20,000. Enough to help you sort out those pesky dwemer cogs.  

[**UI Inspector**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45964/) by Hrnchamd  
UI viewer and interactive editor for Morrowind UIs. Allows inspection of the UI menu hierarchy and all layout values. Layout variables can be modified in-game for fine-tuning your own UIs.  

[**Consistent Main Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45982) by twizz0r  
New high-quality replacer textures that homogenize main menus so that MWSE's MCM and Petethegoat's Continue Mod menu items don't look out of place. Especially useful for those using alternate UI's and/or alternate main menu images. OG version also included for those that roll old school.  

[**Descriptive Descriptions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45991) by Remiros  
This mod adds the item descriptions to the tooltips that have previously been missing. Many items in the game have hidden stats that are relatively important, but never shown in the game. Weapons will now show their speed, reach and enchantment value, armor and clothing will now show their enchantment value and lights will show their total duration. This mod is compatible with all other mods that add to the item tooltips.

## Old MGE/MWSE (<= 2.0) (should still work with MWSE2.1+, but these mods don't use Lua.)
[**MWSE 2.1 Pursuit Revisited**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45904/) by svengineer99  
This is a compilation mod of companion features:

5) Crime, Flee and related AI tweaks  
[**Death and Resurrection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45959) by Xiran  
Death will take Attribute points away from you if (when) killed, so it's better not die too much. You'll be resurrected at the nearest Temple, temporarily much weaker,  must return to where you got killed and pay attention not to die again (or penalty will be higher than in consecutive "normal" deaths) . You can also change your birthsign.  
[**Cast on Strike Bows**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45913) by efrost  
Cast-on-strike enchantments on bows and crossbows work. Arrows and bolts are enchanted on the fly, and they're replaced with their unenchanted versions when you swap them out--even with hotkeys. Enchanted ammo works normally. Make sure MCP's "Fix enchant options on ranged" is **disabled**.  
[**MCC Leveller**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44294) by mg79 - Skills based smooth levelling similar to GCD, where multiple skills contribute to attribute level ups. State-based health. Skills decay if you don't use them for long periods of time.

Overbuff Kickback)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44295) by svengineer99 - enforces caps on the maximum attribute, chameleon, sanctuary and resistance buffs the player can have.  Exceeding the caps can result in attribute damage, knock-down, endurance and health drains.
