An extremely opinionated mod list based on the idea of a wandering bard/writer, who is exploring Tamriel Rebuilt and Vvardenfell in search of treasures and stories. Heavy on quest mods because I wanted an excuse to play through the modjam/MMM mods, as well as the new TR release.  

These mods should all be compatible with each other, or have minimal compatibilities. I'll update as I play if I run into any issues.  

NOT compatible with BCOM, although you could just choose to follow a BCOM-compatible list for the dungeons/locations/towns section and mine for the rest.

Plays weather sound effects in interior cells, but not in places like caves, ruins, etc and places you wouldn't expect to hear them - all with little or no FPS hit.  
- Note: You can use AURA as an alternative. I find some of AURA's features a bit heavy, and I struggle to hear its interior weather sounds, so I use this one instead.  
* [**Character Sound Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49654) by Anumaril21  
CSO is a dynamic, customizable sound overhaul of the movement, combat, and item sounds of Morrowind.

- Note: technically not related to TR as a project, but since the island was moved and improved to fit with TR, and since I consider it essential, I'm putting it here anyway.  
- Note: grab the Solstheim Graphical Replacer as well, for the grass patch (and the replacers if you prefer them)
