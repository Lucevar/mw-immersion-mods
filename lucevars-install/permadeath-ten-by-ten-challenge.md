Challenge where I start with only ten mods installed, and play permadeath. Every time I die I'm allowed to install ten more mods. After 100 mods, that goes down to 5.

Mods I've made are "free" for the purposes of this challenge. Mods they depend on aren't. MGEXE, MWSE, XE Sky Variations, Skills Module, Crafting Framework, Merged Objects, and MCP also considered free.

# Character 1 - Rylen, the Redguard Scout

### Mods I notice myself missing
Graphic Herbalism (because the MOP patch broke)
Weapon Sheathing (because the MOP patch broke)
Let There Be Darkness (ugly darklight in the Census and Excise Office)
Random Chargen

## Round 2 - Next 10 - 13/06/2023
Came back to Morrowind after a long hiatus, decided to start a new round rather than pick up with Rylen where we left off. She didn't last long enough to get attached to, tbh.

Additions this time round focus on my mods (or rather, mods on which I was a co-author), additions to the Bitter Coast, and gameplay/survival.

## My Mods:
* [**Lucewind - Bitter Coast**](https://github.com/Lucevar/lucewind-bitter-coast)
* [**Guild of Vampire Hunters**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45832)
* [**Shal Overgrown**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47219)
* [**The Fires of Orc**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44982)
* [**Ebonheart Underworks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47272)
* [**Mamaea Awakened**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46096)
* [**Baan Binif**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51419)
* [**Tel Aruhn Chronicles**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49171)
* [**Leeches Always Bite Twice**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53010)  
Ok, it's a serious stretch to consider this my mod -- all I can claim is that I inspired it by wandering carelessly through muck ponds on stream. But this is a Bitter Coast-themed round, and I really want to play this, so- it counts. :D 

## Round 2 Mod Additions:
* [**Crafting Framework**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51009)  
Required by Ashfall.  
* [**Skills Module**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034)  
Required by Ashfall, Ultimate Fishing, and Mantle of Ascension.  
* [**Weapon Sheathing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46069)  
Adds visible weapons and sheathes.  
* [**Graphic Herbalism**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599)  
Plants are now visibly depleted or removed when you harvest ingredients from them.  
* [**Glow in the Dahrk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886)  
Exterior and interior windows now reflect the time of day. A huge, huge boost to atmosphere, and one I really miss whenever it's not there.  
* [**Shipyards of Vvardenfell**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51928)  
Going along with the Bitter Coast theme of this round - my Seyda Neen changes in Lucewind - Bitter Coast were made to fit alongside this mod.    
* [**AFFresh**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53006)  
30 new quests around the Seyda Neen / starter towns area - by one of the original developers of Morrowind! It would be a must have even if it weren't BC based, and since it is... 
* [**Ashfall**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057)  
Just too good to miss. I reckon this character will be spending a lot of time wandering around the swamps and living off the land, and frankly I just wanted Ashfall back. It's not the same game without it.  
* [**Ultimate Fishing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52872)  
A new mod by Merlord - and perfect for the Bitter Coast theme.   
* [**Lush Synthesis**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52931)  
This is very nearly the perfect grass mod, and absolutely my new favourite of them. Imperfect only in that it's missing the little mushrooms/rocks from Remi's grass, and some of the larger and more luscious grass types from Ozzy's, but overall a fantastic compromise, and a really gorgeous addition to any game. Plus, sea-cover! 
* [**Graht Morrowind Swamp Trees**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49771) & [**Grahtwood Roost**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52888)  
I'm choosing to count these as one mod because they're made to work together. And because I need the slots. Makes the Bitter Coast treeline extremely dramatic - and adds a house and a quest.
* [**Vapormist**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50517)  
The authors of Graht Morrowind, Grahtwood Roost, and Leeches all recommend using Vapormist together with their mods - so, naturally, let's do it!

I *really* want to add Mantle of Ascension, Joy of Painting, Store Chimes, and Midnight Oil here, but it's more important to get a cohesive Bitter Coast experience starting to come together I think.

And if all that cheating wasn't enough, I also added [**The Sanguine Rose**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46214) because I offered to do some testing. :angel: That also means [**Magicka Expanded**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111?tab=files) because it's a dependency of Sanguine Rose.  

## Round 3 candidates
* Mistify
* Hla Oad
* Hla Odai
* BC textures
* Pet scrib
* Fireplaces
