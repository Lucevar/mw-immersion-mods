# Alternate Chargen Mods
Make the experience of starting a new game far more interesting.  

# UI Changes or Gameplay Additions 
These don't conflict with any of the below, so you can use them alongside your chargen mod of choice.  

[**MWSE Random Character Name Generator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46189) by Aleister  
Adds a random name generator to the chargen name selection UI. **Lucevar's note**: imo it fits in really well and the names it generates are very lore appropriate. As a MWSE mod it also doesn't take up any esp slots. If you've ever thought that thinking of a name is the most difficult part of chargen, I highly recommend this mod.  

[**Randomised Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46915) by Petethegoat  
Randomise everything!  

[**Tidy Charsheet**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45939) by Petethegoat  

[**What Are My Attributes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49912) by RingComics  
Adds an Attribute and Description widget to the Race menu so you can better plan your character.

[**Merlords Character Backgrounds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) by Merlord  
After chargen (vanilla or modded) ends, this mod adds an extra step: choose your character's background. Some are simple stat boosts/maluses, others add scripted events such as challengers seeking to challenge a Famed Warrior or the Framed background which boosts your stealth skills at the cost of sometimes finding yourself with a bounty on your head. It really adds an interesting extra dimension to character generation.  

[**MTR By The Divines**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48031) by MTR  
This mods adds a bunch of deities for player to choose from in a manner seen in Merlord's Character Backgrounds. Beliefs grant some simple abilities to the player, but it's mostly for purpose of role-playing.

[**MTR Lineage**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49996) by MTR  
This mod adds many character lineages that can be selected after character generation.

[**mtrCultures - Role-Playing Mod allowing to choose your cultural background during character creation**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51282) by MTR  
This mod adds character cultures that can be selected after character generation.

[**The Role They Were to Play**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46411) by PoodleSandwich  
Changes the intro video to be gender-neutral.

[**Advantages & Disadvantages**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-4-583) by Cid88  

# Minimalist
Just get a game started more quickly - perfect for testing mods or just skipping the tutorial messages.  

[**Fresh Start**](https://stuporstar.sarahdimento.com/updates/downloads/) by Stuporstar  
Starts you off in Seyda Neen just in front of Fargoth, skipping all the tutorial. If you want to start the main quest you can find a body with the packages for Caius in the river near Balmora.  

[**QuickChar**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364) by Bink and Maximus  
Gives you the option to go through the regular tutorial sequence or to quickstart, which drops you in front of Captain Sellus Gravius to get your disbursal package.  

[**Skip Tutorial**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-5610) by cdcooley  
Gets rid of the tutorial messages and speeds up the chargen npcs, or alternatively starts you off at the door of the Census and Excise Office with Fargoth's ring and 300 gold (to save you having to loot everything).  

# Classes
[**Class Conscious**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46902) by Petethegoat  
Disables custom classes - either pick an existing playable class (including playable classes added by mods) or go through the quiz.  

[**Playable NPC Classes**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43428/) by Atrayonis

**Lucevar's note**: This is the chargen mod that sets the standard for the rest. Unless you specifically want one of the themed chargens, something geared to mod testing, or something lightweight, this is probably the mod you're looking for. It covers most scenarios.

[**Immersive Chargen**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/22921) by Qebensenuf

[**Chargen at Night**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-80-10934) by Xeth-Ban  
Chargen starts at night during a thunderstorm. Makes a surprising amount of difference to the atmosphere!  

[**Chargen Revisited**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45510) by Zobator  
Overhauls the census and excise office and the prison ship. Notably does not get rid of the tutorial messages.
