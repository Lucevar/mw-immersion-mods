# Minimalist Mod List for Beginners
**Updated:** June 8th, 2019

The idea of this mod list is to provide a basic set of mods for new players or a starter set for more experienced modders building a new installation. AKA it's a checklist for me so I don't have to remember or start from scratch every time I start a new game!  

These are listed in roughly the order you should install them.

# Essential 3rd Party Utilities

Make sure to get [**DirectX 9.0c**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) as well - yes, future me reading this, it does have to be THIS version of DirectX.

## Utilities for Mod-Makers
[**TES3 Construction Set**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42196) by Bethesda  
The Construction Set for Steam users, since Steam doesn't include the CS in its download.  
[**Quick Char**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364) by Bink & Maximus

[**Cheat Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47143) by qqqbbb

# UI Improvements
[**Better Dialogue Font**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36873) by Hrnchamd  
[**UI Expansion**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071) by NullCascade    
[**Perfect Placement**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46562) by Hrnchamd  

# Bug Fixes
[**Patch for Purists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096?) by Half11  
[**WIP Detailed Correct UV Rocks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44321/?) by Pherim  
[**Sheep-No-More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45168) by McChuggernaut  
Gets rid of an obnoxious sheep's baa sound effect that plays in the Ashlands.  
[**Fix those bastard rope fences**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45741) by Petethegoat and EJ12  
This colourfully named mod fixes player animations and rope meshes so that you get stuck much, much less often. It's an absolute lifesaver of a mod.  
[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Speaking of life-saving mods, this one fixes a bug where Morrowind will often hang when you try to exit the game (or when you CTD). This will save you a LOT of time.  

## Performance Tweaks
[**Morrowind Optimisation Patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384) by Greatness7 and Remiros  
[**Project Atlas**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399) by Project Atlas Team  

## Dialogue Fixes  

## Balance Fixes
[**Morrowind Anti-Cheese**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47305) by Remiros  
Balances a lot of content that was way out of line of the game's overall balance curve, and removes a lot of easy exploits.  
[**Bloodmoon Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714) by mort  
[**Tribunal Rebalance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713) by mort  
[**Beware the Sixth House**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46036) by mort  
Mort's suite of balance mods make the expansions actually playable without hyper-efficient min-maxing or an extremely late-game character. It's no longer instant death for a sub-lvl30 character to walk around on Solstheim. The main questlines of the expansions are still tough. Beware the Sixth House rebalances the main quest so that Dagoth Ur and his minions are the game's most difficult challenge - as it should be.

# Expansion Integration
Note that both of these issues have been addressed in Patch for Purists since version 3.0.0. You may prefer to use the unmerged version of PFP, and skip the Expansion Implementation esp if you prefer to use the mods below.

There are a *lot* of options for these, particularly to delay the Dark Brotherhood attacks added by the Tribunal expansion. I personally use these:  
[**Trigger Dark Brotherhood Attack**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-37-15581) by Cyran0  
This adds a short quest that creates the pretense for making the player a target for assassination. Since the quest is a condition for the Dark Brotherhood attacks it effectively delays the start of the Tribunal main quest until the player decides it is appropriate. The quest is not available until the player has attained at least level six. Additionally, the weaker assassins have been re-equipped with appropriately less-valuable armor.  

[**Solstheim Delayer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45988) by Red Furry Demon  
The quest that gets you to Solstheim is quite annoying if you do not plan to go there, but need Bloodmoon active because some mods require it. This mod makes changes to a few dialogue lines, giving them more specific speaker conditions and slightly altering their quest stage results, so that you won't get any journal entry unless you actually ask about Solstheim.  

Alternatives:  
[**Delayed DB Attack v2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/14891?) by Kir  
[**Solstheim Rumour Fix - Fixed - Fixed**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47053) by Gavrilo93, nomoresam, and Illy

### Bitter Coast
While I'll leave most of my location/landscape recommendations to another list, I find that the following mods make a huge difference to how well the Bitter Coast blends in with groundcover mods. Most of this list is optional, but this section is... superoptional or something.  

[**Bitter Coast Redux I - Landscape**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45708) by CptJoker  
[**Bitter Coast Redux II - Trees & Flora**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45762) by CptJoker  
[**Scum Retexture - Alternative 2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42582) by Lougian  

### Groundcover
There are four primary options for groundcover mods. Generally speaking groundcover mods are modular by region so you can pick and choose which options you like best for each region. 

To use these, generate distant land with the grass esps included. **DO NOT** activate the esps in Morrowind Launcher/Wrye Mash etc. You will encounter terrible fps and collision problems if you try to play with the esps active. 

[**Remiros Groundcover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46733) by Remiros  
Includes groundcover for Tamriel Rebuilt  
[**Aesthesia Groundcover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46377) by Rytelier  
Includes groundcover for Tamriel Rebuilt  
[**Vurt's Groundcover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/31051) by Vurt - usually paired with [**Azura's Coast and Sheogorath Grass**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/30788) by Muspila  
[**Ozzy's Groundcover**](https://www.moddb.com/mods/ozzys-grass-merged-openmw-compatible/downloads/ozzys-grass-merged-103) by Ozzy
